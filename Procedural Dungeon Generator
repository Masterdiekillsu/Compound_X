    This will act as a step-by-step list of guidelines to help people build fun, functioning 
maps. It may be a good idea to have a few pages of notes detailing any special rules 
for your map, as well as the inventories, gear, and personalities of your characters.


==============================
The Base Map
==============================
    
        Firstly, determine the planet or region this map will take place in, as 
well as any area-specific rules that may apply. 

    Some examples include:
    * The map being on a water world with most or all of the environment underwater. The 
characters would either have to use underwater breathing gear, or the map-builder would 
have to write their own breath-holding rules.
    * In space with no air or gravity. There are rules in place dealing with movement in 
microgravity, as well as EVA suits that the players could use. 
    * In a snowstorm with very limited visibility but also the ability to track people based on 
their footprints. The hunter class might be very useful in a situation such as this, because 
their awareness might be the reason that the players get to surprise an enemy patrol, instead 
of the other way around.
    * On a volcanic planet where staying outside too long without a mask can injure or blind 
the players. Robots and humanoids with environment helmets would probably be fine here, while 
anybody else might be forced to stay inside or be hindered by the air quality outside.
    
    If no specific rules exist for the map you want to make, it will be up to you to create 
them. In general, map-specific rules should not be a major hinderance to the players, but 
should make the experience more interesting and challenging. If traversing the map is harder
than fighting the enemies, then it might not be a fun game for anybody. It's entirely up to 
the GM's discretion, however. The map should be as difficult as it needs to be to keep the 
players interested the whole time, without getting every one of them killed.
        
==============================
Map Layout
==============================
    
        Create the general layout of the map. Before actually drawing up any part of 
the map, it's best to have an idea of what it will look like beforehand. Is it mostly 
indoors or outdoors? How many buildings are there? If there are buildings, how large 
are they? Will there be any space for vehicles? How large is each space on the board? 
Many indoor maps use 1x1 meter squares, while outdoor maps can be much larger, 
depending on the context. If the map is intended to be mostly vehicle combat on a massive 
open field, it could make sense to have 5x5 squares or larger. 
        Next, you need add your smaller structures and natural objects. This includes 
roads, bunkers, trees, rocks, hills, and any other terrain details. The layout of your map 
should be simple to navigate as well as easy to understand from a glance. Natural objects 
should look like they belong there. Trees should usually grow fairly close together, but 
not so close as to be unpassable. 
    
==============================
Add Details
==============================
      
        Now the map needs smaller details to help flesh it out. This is when you add in all
of the objects that will be scattered about the map. Place tables and chairs in rooms that 
require them. Create specific items that fit the area they're in, such as dangerous chemicals 
in a science lab or bunks in a military camp. Computer or electrical panels are also very 
important. They allow the players to interface with the map in a unique way, and in some 
cases can be pivotal to the story you are trying to play. When building a map, it's usually 
a good idea to keep it fairly realistic, but the most important thing to remember is that the 
players must have fun and that the game be interesting. 

        It's important to write down small details of a map before playing it. It doesn't need 
to be too in-depth, but it needs to be enough that the GM can improv something interesting, 
depending on what the players do. 

    For Example: 
    *  A computer terminal may have access to certain areas of a building, but be locked out of 
others. It would also be a good idea to think of how the system is secured, as players 
are able to infiltrate the network.
    *  A heavily reinforced door might be accessible if the players find the correct wiring in 
the walls. In general, it's a good idea to have multiple ways for the players to solve a 
problem. If the there is only one route through your game, it might start to get boring.
    *  A scrap of paper tacked onto a message board might have the keycode to access a safe 
where the players might be able to find some loot.
    *  If you create something that doesn't have rules written for it, feel free to write your 
own for the encounter. If the enemies in your game have been creating a light-activated, face-
melting, explosive poison gas, then it's your job to determine exactly how it works.
    
==============================
Add NPCs and Hostiles
==============================
    
        Lastly, your dungeon should have non-playable characters in it. For the sake of interesting 
story, it's usually a good idea for your characters to have some kind of backstory, whether it's 
as simple as the organization they work for, or as complicated as the entire detailed story of their 
life. Combat personnel should be given weapons and armor based off of their levels, and depending on
the character, you can also give them other skills and feats to go along with their class. Exactly what
kind of gear they are given is very much up to you and how you want to run your dungeon, but as a 
rule of thumb, it's a good idea to make combat fast-paced, tactical, and enjoyable for everybody.
