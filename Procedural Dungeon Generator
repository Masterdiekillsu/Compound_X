    This will act as a step-by-step checklist to help people build unique maps.


==============================
The Base Map
==============================
    
        Firstly, determine the planet or region this map will take place in, as 
well as any area-specific rules that may apply. Some examples include the map 
being on a water world with most or all of the environment underwater, in space 
with no air or gravity, in a snowstorm with very limited visibility but also the 
ability to track people based on their footprints, on a volcanic planet where 
staying outside too long without a mask can injure or blind the players, etc. 
If no specific rules exist for the map you want to make, it will be up to you to 
create them. In general, map-specific rules should not be a major hinderance to 
the players, but should make the experience more interesting and challenging. If 
traversing the map is harder than fighting the enemies, then it won't be a fun game
for anybody.
        
==============================
Map Layout
==============================
    
        Create the general layout of the map. Before actually drawing up any part of 
the map, it's best to have an idea of what it will look like beforehand. Is it mostly 
indoors or outdoors? How many buildings are there? If there are buildings, how tall 
are they? Will there be any space for vehicles? How large is each space on the board? 
Many indoor maps use 1x1 meter squares, while outdoor maps can be much larger, 
depending on the context. If the map is intended to be mostly vehicle combat on a massive 
open field, it could make sense to have 5x5 squares or larger. 
        Next, you need add your smaller structures and natural objects. This includes 
roads, bunkers, trees, rocks, hills, and any other terrain details. The layout of your map 
should be simple to navigate as well as easy to understand from a glance. Natural objects 
should look like they belong there. Trees should usually grow fairly close together, but 
not so close as to be unpassable.
