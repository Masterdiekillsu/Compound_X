		INTRODUCTION
    =====================================
For more information on how armor functions in CX, please see topic 
"Armor and Getting Hit" in the Basic Rules document.

	   ---- ARMOR SYSTEMS ----
Armor Systems are composed of an armor rig and a protective material. 
Having lots of armor may slow you down, but armor will prevent you from 
being easy prey. Armor rigs can be broken down into 4 pieces: helmets,
chest rigs, arm rigs, and leg rigs. 
	Helmets protect against special abilities that target your face-hole so 
they aren't needed until later in the game, or they are probably never needed
becayse that's not how do teh bulluts. 
	The other 3 riggings provide ammunition space and (most rigs) provide
space for installing an armor material. Armor Materials must be purchased 
separately than Armor Rigs. Also, armor systems do not include any protection
without an armor material. If you purchase more than one material* to cover 
your whole body (installing in the arm, leg, and chest rigs, for example) it 
improves the armor coverage (% of armor protection), but not the quantity of 
armor points (APs) or the armor piercing level (APL). 
	For example: if you purchase a chest rig from the Medium Armor Systems
category and a Standard L1 material, you'll have 40% coverage, 40 APs, and an 
APL of 1. Now, in addition, if you purchase the leg rig from the Medium Armor 
Systems and a Standard L1 material, you'd have 55% coverage, 40 APs, and an
APL of 1.
*Note: you cannot mix-and-match materials or rig categories. Only one kind of 
material for the one category of rigging you are wearing.

	---- WHERE IS MY AMMO STORAGE? ----
If you are wearing any armor rigging, you have a certain amount of "Mag Space".
When you are loading up your guns before a mission, you can decide how to 
arrange your Mag Space to suit your needs. "Mag Space" translates 1 to 1
into Primary Magazines, and 2 to 3 (or 1 to 1) into Secondary Magazines.
	For example, if I have had chest rig from the Recon Armor Systems category, I 
would have 5 Mag Space. I can turn that Mag Space into 3 Primary Magazine and 3
Secondary Magazine spaces, 5 Primary Magazine spaces, or any feasible combination. 

	---- WHAT IS AN 'ADVANCED RIG'? ----
Advanced (adv.) rigs typically provide less armor coverage and magazine space 
than their regular counterparts, but they allow you to attach Shield Generators,
Hard Point Equipment, and/or Cloaking Equipment. Advanced rigs allow you to do
this by providing 'Hard Points'. Hard Points are special joints and fittings that
make it easy to attach equipment. When you purchase equipment, it will list how
many Hard Points it consumes. You can't attach more equipment than you have available
Hard Point space.
	Hard Point Equipment/Shields/Cloaking often come in two sizes, "Primary Modules" and 
"Secondary Modules". After you purchase and install a Primary Module, you can also purchase
and install a Secondary Module(s) that augments the benefits of the Primary Module. The 
benefits are listed in the description of a given module. They do not mix and match,
Secondary Modules only work for the Primary Module they are designed for.
	Some modules have a "____ Skill Requirement". In order to operate the module, you
must have the required amount of the given skill.

 * SHIELD UNITS
 * Shields cover the wearer in a magnetic field which repels lasers and
 * removes some of the brunt of plasma bolts. They are completely open to
 * balistic fire, however. Traditionally a shield unit consists of a generator
 * pack which is generally the size of a small backpack, and some Magnetic
 * Field Stabilizers that extend over the areas of the body which would be
 * covered by the shield.
 * Once the shield's capacitor units are exhausted, the shield breaks and
 * needs a while to recharge. If the user maintains their shield without
 * letting it break, they can avoid the costly recharge time.
 * The capacity of the field is dependant on the user mainly, but also varies 
 * depending on the shield model.

 * NANITE CLOAKING ARMOURS
 * Devote a Portion of your nanite pool to a clocking pool.
 * Lvl 1-5 expend 15 Nanites per cloak turn. Lvl 6+ 10 Nanites.
 * Max Turns of cloak = Lvl +1; Cloaking becomes available after waiting 4 
 * Actions.
 * Cloaking grants the wearer stealth at a DC of 50. However, when a player 
 * cloaks, enemies will not see them unless they are actively looking for the 
 * wearer. For enemies that saw the wearer cloak, the DC is 25 less.
 * Wearers need only expend nanites on a turn that they perform actions. if 
 * they are doing nothing but watching, they may cloak for free. Cloaking 
 * requires concentration, so when a user diverts their attention to perform 
 * an action, they must use some nanites to continue to hold the cloak.
