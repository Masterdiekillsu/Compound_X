Any reinforced armour, the amount of Damage Reduction is rolled at the time of 
purchase. A Carbon-Steel Fiber Titanium Reinforced armour plate might be 
anywhere from 26-35 DR for its lifetime, depending on what you roll when you 
purchase it. These armours are a bit of a gamble, since they may provide 
better protection than the next tier up, or they might only provide marginally 
better protection than the last tier.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Undersuits
//Various undersuits exist, providing buffs to the wearer. Undersuits are
//wearable by all classes unless otherwise stated. Undersuits provide a 
//damage reduction to any hits that miss armour. Additionally any damage
//which only affect a limb has the suit's DR applied to it. Undersuits
//count as a full set of clothing, so any clothes worn over them look out
//of place.
    //Flightsuits offer basic protection from the elements.
    //Traditionally come in Tan, Olive Drab, Wolf-Grey, Dark Earth, Black, 
    //Camo Patterns, etc.

/*========================================
 * SHIELD UNITS
 * Shields cover the wearer in a magnetic field which repels lasers and
 * removes some of the brunt of plasma bolts. They are completely open to
 * balistic fire, however. Traditionally a shield unit consists of a generator
 * pack which is generally the size of a small backpack, and some Magnetic
 * Field Stabilizers that extend over the areas of the body which would be
 * covered by the shield.
 * Once the shield's capacitor units are exhausted, the shield breaks and
 * needs a while to recharge. If the user maintains their shield without
 * letting it break, they can avoid the costly recharge time.
 * The capacity of the field is dependant on the user mainly, but also varries 
 * depending on the shiled model.

 * NANITE CLOAKING ARMOURS
 * Devote a Portion of your nanite pool to a clocking pool.
 * Lvl 1-5 expend 15 Nanites per cloak turn. Lvl 6+ 10 Nanites.
 * Max Turns of cloak = Lvl +1; Cloaking becomes available after waiting 4 
 * Actions.
 * Cloaking grants the wearer stealth at a DC of 50. However, when a player 
 * cloaks, enemies will not see them unless they are actively looking for the 
 * wearer. For enemies that saw the wearer cloak, the DC is 25 less.
 * Wearers need only expend nanites on a turn that they perform actions. if 
 * they are doing nothing but watching, they may cloak for free. Cloaking 
 * requires concentration, so when a user diverts their attention to perform 
 * an action, they must use some nanites to continue to hold the cloak.
