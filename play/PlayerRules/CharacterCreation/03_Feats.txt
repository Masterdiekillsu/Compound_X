smgs, etc. While wielding dual weapons, you may fire both at the same time

+10 damage for each bullet).
You have to reload a fresh magazine in order to trigger the bonus again. In other words, you cannot use
First Shot Counts more times in one encounter than the number of fresh magazines you are carrying. If
your weapon damages an area, First Shot Counts does not take effect.

bonuses. (any teammates in such a vehicle do not take double damage)

Prerequisites: Luck 7
