============================================================
MELEE WEAPONS & UNARMED FIGHTING
These weapons/attacks use an 'Accuracy Modifier' instead of
a 'Miss Chance'. This modifier is added to your combat dex modifier and
and any relevant skill(s) to help you beat your opponent's guard DC.
Melee weapons don't normally pierce armor, unless they state otherwise.

If you have Hand-to-Hand trained, +10 damage to all melee attacks with a weapon.
Instead, if you have Hand-to-Hand Expert, +20 damage to all melee attacks with a weapon. 

Also, If you have melee combat skill >=20 then all DEX or STR requirements for 
melee weapons are reduced by 1.
