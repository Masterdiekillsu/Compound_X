		Overview
	Some militaries in the Terran Empire have employed the use of 
large mechanical warsuits operated by a single pilot. This class of
armor-vehicle hybrid is colloquially called "Power Suits." Power 
Suits tend to be slow, tough and pack an ammount of punch rarely 
seen by infantry. 

		Power
	As the name implies, most power suits carry a power plant
on them that runs their various weapons, parts and chassis. A
Power Suit may carry, but not activate or use a part or weapon
that would exceed the power capacity of the suit's power plant.

		Modes
	Power Armor has three modes. Switching between modes takes
Two actions for a pilot in the armor. These modes are:
		- Combat
		- Maneuver
		- Shutdown
	In combat mode, the suit works as expected. The pilot
may direct the armor to move, fire and scan using its various 
actions.
	In Maneuver mode, the suit cannot use any of its active
components or weapons. However it gains a bonus to move speed as
listed in the chassis's Maneuver Bonus. 
	In Shutdown mode, the suit is much more difficult to hack.
However the suit cannot scan, move nor use active components or 
weapons. If the Power Suit's power output no longer meets or 
exceeds its power requirement, it immediately enters shutdown mode.

		Cover
	Power Suits are much larger than standard infantry, and 
are typically a little less graceful to boot. They Cannot use the
hunker action. Furthermore partial cover has no effect on the 
accuracy of an enemy firing at a Power Suit and good cover acts 
as parital cover for power suits. Due to their sheer size, enemies
get a flat -20% to miss when firing at power suits.
