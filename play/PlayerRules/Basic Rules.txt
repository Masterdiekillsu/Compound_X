Welcome to Compound X!

This document was created in order to help clear up how everything works in 
this game.
==============================
Premise:
==============================
Welcome to Compound X! The specific time and place that your adventure takes
place is up to your Game Master (often called a GM for short), but all of them
take place far in the future where humans have left earth on their faster-than-light
spaceships to explore dangerous new worlds fraught with friend and foe of all
manner of robots and aliens! 
Will you be the dashing hero? Or perhaps the evil villain plotting galactic 
domination? Or maybe a mercenary who's somewhere in between? The choice is
yours and your legend will be told as you play the game!
 
==============================
The Primary Game Mechanic:
==============================

You may now be thinking to yourself; "Self-person, we sure can't wait to go
gallivanting through the galaxy doing fantastic things and seeing the beautiful
galaxies! But how would we do that?" Well, yourself doesn't have the answer yet,
but good news! You just found it!

In Compound X, most things you will do will be accompanied by a 'roll'. That 
translates to rolling the dice. Rolling the dice is our way of factoring in
the human (or not human) tendency to do things in a way which isn't perfect.
When you roll high, you do very well. When you roll low, you goof up. But hold 
your horses, or kangaroo or what have you. This is a strategy RPG, not a gambling game.
Each roll will have numbers which you will add to or subtract from the one you 
get from the dice. This represents how good or bad your particular character is
at doing whatever it is you are attempting to do. What to add when is discussed
in detail below. 

For now, know that Compound X uses two ten-sided dice (usually called D10s) to
represent a d100, a percent. One of the D10s represents the number in the 10's place.
the other represents the number in the 1's place. Most dice sets come with two
D10s, one with a zero after the number on the face, the other without that zero.
In that case, obviously you add the numbers on the face of the dice together to
find out what you rolled. If your dice came from different sets, you must pick
which dice represents the tens place before you roll. i.e. if one die rolls a
40 and the other rolls a 6, you rolled 46%. Alternatively, if you have an orange
die which represents your ten's place and a purple die which represents your one's
place, and you roll an orange 3 and a purple 9 then you rolled 39%.

It's important to note that you don't have to roll for everything. Your character
probably knows how to do mundane things like brush their teeth, open an unlocked
door, and tie their shoes. It's okay to just do these things, even in combat.

==============================
Role Playing and Combat:
==============================

Compound X has two main 'modes' if you will: Combat, and Not in Combat. While in
combat, the rules are a little more specific so as to support strategy and planning.
During combat, each player takes their turn in a particular order, and while you can
still make up what you want to do, most actions fall into pre-existing categories 
that take a specific amount of time and typically do a specified amount of damage. 
More detail on that in the combat section of basic rules.

Out of combat, turns are a little more fluid. Usually players take their turn 
describing what they want to do when each player gets an idea of what to do.
If two players have an idea at the same time, please be courteous and take turns. It's
much easier for the GM to listen to one player at a time. In addition to taking 
turns, please also be polite and share the spotlight. You ALL are the main heroes 
or villains of this story. Make sure everyone gets a chance to do the one-liner they
want, or to have their moment of glory.

Either in combat or out, play usually follows this loop:

1.	The GM describes the environment and the situation. Usually the DM will ask
		"What do you want to do?"
2.	The player describes what they want to do
3. 	The GM checks if that's even a possible thing that can be done. (skip this
		step if that's obvious)
4.	The GM says what kind of roll is needed to see if the player succeeds, if 
		any roll is necessary.
5.	The player rolls the dice and adds the numbers as described below.
6. 	The GM checks their total against the Difficulty Challenge, a number that
		typically only the GM knows which represents how hard a typical task
		is. Then the GM narrates how the action goes depending on if the 
		player succeeds or fails and by how much.
7.	Then the next player begins their turn.

==============================
Your Character:
==============================
In Compound X, you control one particular person. This person is your avatar
in the game world. You decide what they say, how they react and what they do
just by telling your Game Master at the appropriate time. But before you can
jump right in and start playing, you need to create a character! This is often
one of the most fun parts of the game!
Making a character is a slightly involved process that can take a new player 
up to two hours to fully flesh out. There are several parts of characters which
are detailed below, but let's list them here briefly before we get into the 
nitty-gritty of it.

Base Stats - These decide what raw characteristics make up your character, and 
	are factored into most other decisions you make both in game and for the 
	rest of character creation. Choosing your stats is a very good way to start
	making a character.
Species/Race - Is your character a robot? What about a human? Or maybe the 
	catlike aliens known as Tundari? Different species and races get small
	bonuses to different aspects of combat and are liked or disliked by 
	different people in the galaxy accordingly.
Class 		- Think of this like your job. Are you a sniper, waiting for the
	perfect shot? Or are you a pilot who can thread a needle with your 
	starfighter? Or maybe you're a veteran soldier, who's seen it all. 
	Classes define what armor and weapons your character can use in combat,
	as well as certain special abilities which might help solve puzzles or
	get you better discounts at stores. Your class also dictates how much 
	money you start with to buy equipment.
Skills		- Each character learns things while going through life. Maybe
	your time in the military taught you how to navigate using the stars
	or maybe your time working at a mechanic's shop made you good at 
	repairing things? Or maybe you're one of those people who is just
	naturally good at hacking computers. Picking these numbers will
	represent that in the game world. 
Equipment	- Your equipment is made up of your character's weapon, armor
	and miscellaneous items. You'll get money to buy them with at the start
	of the game and you'll earn more money as you go about your adventures.
Feats		- Your character will gain special perks as you level up. This
	could range from reloading really fast, to having more health to being
	able to do a fast combat roll under fire. Tackle these when your 
	character advances to level 3.



==============================
Player Stats:
==============================

Each player has what are called Base Stats. An average person has a '5' for
each stat, but an average player has a '6'. Base Stats are split into Primary
and Secondary stats. Primary stats are determined by your Base Stat points.
Secondary stats are derived from several primary stats. For every point in a primary
stat, a secondary stat point is awarded (if the primary and secondary stats are
associated). If a secondary stat is contributed to by more than one primary stat,
you can assign as many points to the common secondary stat as you have points
in the largest of the associated primary stats.
These stats are as follows (secondary stat associations are indented):
Strength
      ╠═ Carry Ability
      ╚═ Movement Speed
Perception
Fortitude
      ╚═ Carry Ability
Charisma
      ╚═ Skill Point Gain
Intelligence
      ╚═ Skill Point Gain
Dexterity
      ╚═ Movement Speed
Luck

Secondary stat assignment example: let's assume you have assigned your character
6 Strength, 3 Dexterity, and 2 Fortitude. Dexterity only has one secondary stat, movement 
speed, so you would put 3 secondary stat points into movement speed. Likewise,
Fortitude only has Carry Ability, so 2 points are assigned there. 
	Strength has 6 secondary stat point to assign; you can assign an additional 3
stat points to movement speed (for a maximum of 6 movement speed) which leaves 3 additional 
points for Carry Ability (for a total of 5 points). Or you can do any other combination, so
long as Carry Ability and Movement speed don't exceed 6 points (because strength is the 
highest primary stat associated with Carry Ability and Movement Speed). 
	In the case that you have more secondary points than you can use, (such as
if you assigned 5 points to Strength, Fortitude, and Dexterity) save them for later.
You can increase your base stats and apply the secondary points later (see section,
Leveling Up).

Usually you can tell a lot about a character just by their base stats. For
instance, a character with 9 strength and 3 intelligence is usually either
a brutish bully or a tough but lovable teddy bear of a person. Where a 
character with 10 intelligence and 2 charisma is probably a brilliant 
nerd who might be shy or just have a terrible stutter.

But your raw base stat is rarely used in calculations during the game. To
get the math to work out better, we usually us what is called a 'Stat Bonus'.
Stat bonuses are used very often. They are calculated as so:

Stat Bonus = (4 * Stat) - 20 
	which is equal to 
Stat Bonus = (Stat - 5) * 4
	if that's any easier.

For instance, if you were trying to lift something heavy, your GM may tell you
to roll a 'Strength Check' and add your 'Strength Bonus'. To do this, you would
roll two 10-sided dice as explained in the Primary Game Mechanic above, and add
your Strength Bonus to that. Let's say that you rolled a 71, and your Strength
Base Stat is a very beefy 8. Then your Strength bonus would be:
(8 - 5) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12
and the score of your roll would be 
71 + 12 = 83
That's a really high roll! But that may or may not be enough to lift the object
depending on how heavy it is!

Ranged and melee weapon accuracy bonuses use a slightly different equation than the 
above Stat Bonus equation, as combat accuracy rolls are played out on a d10 scale:

Combat Accuracy Stat Bonus = (0.3 * Stat) - 1.5
	which is equal to 
Combat Accuracy Stat Bonus = (Stat - 5) * 0.3
	if that's any easier.

Round any remaining decimal to the nearest whole number that gives the best accuracy,
after accounting for weapon attachments (if relevant). For example, let's say you have
6 Perception, your PER mod (for ranged accuracy) would be 0.3, which you would round 
to +1 bonus accuracy (-1 miss chance). 
	In another instance you may have 7 Perception (and thus a 0.6 combat bonus) 
and you are wielding a weapon with a 3.2x Basic Scope (0.5 bonus accuracy). Your total 
bonus accuracy before rounding is:
0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1
Which you would round to 2 bonus accuracy (-2 miss chance).

Each Base Stat has different specific effects. They are detailed below.

Strength:
	How strong are you? This stat dictates how big of a gun you can carry and
	how hard you can punch or hit with strength melee weapons. It might also allow 
	you to solve puzzles with the brute force approach.
		If you have 1 Strength, you are exceptionally weak and your max movement per
	2 actions is 2m (unless your Dex is 1) and you cannot wear armor that offers more 
	than 50% coverage.
Perception: 
	Your ability to see, hear, smell and sense the world around you, as well as
	to interpret what those sensations indicate. Perception affects your weapon 
	accuracy and ability to cut through the chaos of battle to stay oriented. A high
	perception makes you harder to sneak up on. 
		If you have 1 Perception, you are partially blind, only have 1 eye, or
	something similar. You cannot use the Search or Awareness skills and you have a 
	-20 malus to Speech skill rolls. 
Fortitude: 
	How tough are you? Fortitude dictates your maximum health, how hard you are to 
	knock off of your feet, and contributes to your saving throws.
		If you have 1 Fortitude, you are exceptionally frail. You can't inflict lethal 
	unarmed damage and your unarmed damage is halved. Also, when you deal melee damage, 
	you inflict half of the damage on yourself.
Charisma: 
	How good are you at communicating with those around you? Charisma affects a 
	number of interpersonal skills like haggling and diplomacy. It also contributes to 
	how hard it is to dominate your will.
		If you have 1 Charisma, you have a debilitating speech impediment. You have
	an additional malus of -24 when using Speech, Deceive, and etc. skill. Under normal 
	circumstances, you have to succed a DC 30 CHA skill check in order to communicate 
	with a non-player character (NPC). In combat, vocal communication to anything costs
	1 Action.
Intelligence: 
	How smart are you? Intelligence dictates how many Nanites you have to cast spells
	with or use certain Feats and abilities. It also affects how quickly you acquire new
	skills when you	level up and how proficient you are at using some of those skills.
		If you have 1 intelligence, let's just say, you aren't particularly smart. 
	You cannot attempt to use any skill that you do not have Proficiency in (see the 
	"RP / Using Skills" section).
Dexterity: 
	How nimble are you? Dexterity decides your maximum move speed in combat, as well 
	as how much damage you do with finesse melee weapons like knives. Dexterity also 
	contributes to skill checks for doing things with a character's body like climbing,
	jumping, or dancing.
		If you have 1 Dexterity, you are especially clumsy or suffer from a debilitating
	illness which affects your ability to move swiftly and precisely. You cannot learn any
	skills that use Dexterity as the contributing stat (for example, lockpicking).
Luck: 
	Some people are just lucky! A GM will often have you roll luck to see if a door was
	left unlocked or if you just happened to duck to pick up a coin off the ground right 
	when an assassin is trying to shoot you in the head. Luck also has a significant effect
	on what loot you find in dungeons and your chance to roll a critical hit.
		If you have 1 Luck, it goes without saying, you are very unlucky. At the start of
	a combat encounter, roll a d10 and receive a penalty from the Black Cat table, below.

Assigning Stats to a new character
	When making a new character, you'll have to assign their Base stats.
This will tell you a lot about your character. When assigning your stats,
no stat can be higher than a 9 before applying racial/species bonuses and
no stat can be lower than a 1 after applying racial/species bonuses. 
Additionally, even after race/species bonuses, feats, equipment and base stat 
bonuses from leveling, no stat can ever be over 15 until your character is 
level 15. After level 15, the limit for stat points is 20. The number of 
initial base stat points that you have to apply is listed with your Race or 
Species. See chapter 1: Races if you haven't yet. 

Leveling Up:
Gain feats according to the table below.
With Intelligence 9 or higher, receive more feats. The feats listed in the table are totals, 
not to be added together.
every level, gain 2*(Skill Point Gain) skill points
every 5th level, +1 Class feat
On levels 5, 9, 15 and 20, gain a stat point. The stat increase happens before any 
calculations, so if you had 10 int, and increased to 11, you would get 22 skill points
for the level. Additionally, any stat point alteration forces a recalculation on all
affected values.

==============================
Saving Throws
==============================

Saving throws are used in dire or critical situations to defend against very 
negative effects.
    - Will: defend against a mind affect (Ex: throw off hopelessness after 
    	crashing in an escape pod)
    - Shock: maintain composure after serious damage (Ex: stay conscious after 
    	being shot by a high caliber round)
    - Reflex: quickly react to an event (Ex: dodge falling debris, fire at an 
    	enemy if they leap from one piece of cover to another).
the equations are as follows:
    - Will: 2*(Cha + Int - 6) Rational: Normally wisdom would be applied, so 
    	Will in compound X is descried as your internal voice motivating you to
        endure a mental hardship.
    - Shock: 2*(Fort + Int - 6) Rational: You need to recognize that you are 
    	in shock, and resist its physical effects.
    - Reflex: 2*(Per + Dex - 6) Rational: In order to react quickly to an event
    	you need to be able to see it coming.

==============================
Medicine Saving Throws
==============================

Ouch! you've just been shot! You'd better call for a medic or apply a medikit 
before you bleed out! "But how do I use a medikit? Or if I'm a medic, how do I 
stabilize and heal an ally?" I''m glad you asked. The rules are as follows:
The medicine DC is equal to the damage dealt. On a fail skill check, no 
healing occurs. On a success, heal an amount equal to Medic skill + DC surplus.
Ex: player is dealt 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic rolls an 86 (with 
medic skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health healed.
Individual wounds are healed individually. 3 20 damage wounds needs three 
rolls of 21 or higher.
Ex: Player takes 70 damage. Medic has 25 skill. Medic rolls an 86 (with medic 
skill), so they heal 25+(86-70) for 41 health. Now the player still has a 29 
damage deficit (70-41), so the medic would need to roll over a DC of 29 to 
heal the remaining 29 damage. (Cannot overheal a wound).
Medics need not use a medic-kit so long as the have their medicine bag (or 
equivalent) on their person. If they do not have their medicine bag with them 
when they are trying to heal a teammate, they can make the attempt at a +20 DC.
Using a medikit:
Medic-kit, non-medic user: works as if you are a medic with skill 30.
Medic-kit, medic user: Works as normal, but add 30 to amount healed.

==============================
RP / Using Skills:
==============================

The GM may ask you to roll a certain skill to see if your character can do 
something. This may be something like, "Roll Awareness to see if you spot the 
truck barreling towards you," or it might look like, "Roll Medicine to see if 
you can patch up the gaping wound in your chest spewing blood." Anytime you 
need to Pass a Skill check, there will be a DC (Difficulty Check) you have to 
exceed in order to successfully pass the check. Again: YOU MUST ROLL *OVER* A DC 
TO SUCCEED IN A SKILL CHECK. the DC does not need to be given out by the GM, but if
a DC seems too high, you have the right to grumble (but seriously, ask your GM if 
something seems too difficult. There is usually a reason why tying your shoe 
takes a DC of 70% on that particular day, etc). After you have rolled, please
apply any and all relevant skills to your result. If you are rolling to silently
take down an opponent, the GM can either have you roll a stealth check and an 
unarmed combat check, or double the DC, and have you roll once adding both 
modifiers. Also add any relevant Stat Bonuses to a roll. When rolling 
awareness, add your PER Bonus, etc.
At any time out of combat, you may decide to use one of your skills. If you 
are not pressured by imminent / immediate danger, you may "take a 100%" to pass 
a skill check, then apply any ranks in the skill. When rushed by a time 
constraint or danger, you can "take a 50%" to pass a skill check, then apply any 
ranks in said skill. However, some checks cannot be passed in this way. If you 
are staring at a ship''s blast doors, and want to kick them down, you can't take
additional time to increase your odds of success.
If you want to use a skill in combat, see the "Combat: Actions" subsection.
Skill ranks are exact percentiles to pass a skill check. If you have 50 ranks 
in a skill, then you have a +50% chance to pass a skill check for that skill. 
Every time you purchase a new skill for 10 Skill points, it starts as a +10% 
skill. When leveling up you may add up to 10 points to any one skill.
Normally a character can attempt any skill check whether or not they have invested 
in learning the skill; however, sometimes a character will have more penalties if
they attempt to use a skill that they don't have "Proficiency" in. A character has 
Proficiency in a skill when they have 10 or more skill points in that skill.

Defenders win ties for opposing rolls. If a character ties a DC they fail.

==============================
Player Weapon Customization:
==============================

Weapon customization can be done anytime you are in a town, space station, or 
other mercantile area. Ask the GM if there are weapon shops or kiosks around, 
they should point you to one. From there you can apply upgrades and 
attachments.
The GM may tell you specific attachments that are available, or they may say 
you can just go about your usual customization. See the Attachments document
for more details on the kinds of attachments you can use, and their restrictions.

==============================
Combat:
==============================

Combat starts when either you or an enemy decides they would like to make an 
attack. Each "Player turn" lasts 4-6 seconds, and consists of 4 "Actions" 
(described below).

At any time when using a melee or ranged weapon, you have a minimum of -2 weapon
miss chance, and a minimum of 1 Auto or burst miss chance (if relevant). These 
minimums apply after all PER/DEX/STR/Attachment modifiers, at all ranges, and 
before cover and any other environmental effects. Using an ability could push 
you below the minimum miss chance.

Melee Notes:
A character occupies 1m of space. however, as Compound X is not played out on a 
squares-board, usually it doesn''t matter if two players are within the same 
1m space.
Two Players locked in melee combat are considered to be in adjacent 1m spaces, 
not in the same 1m space. Have you ever seen a fight? you don't start 
face-to-face unless you're at a bar.
Generally speaking, once a character has initiated melee combat with another 
character, they are both considered to be in "melee combat," and occupy 
adjacent 1m spaces. At this point (unless one character has a CQB weapon) 
both characters are assumed to be using their fists or other melee weapons. If
a character wishes to leave melee combat, they incur a "penalty attack." 
Characters also incur "penalty attacks" when moving through or next to an 
enemy character''s 1m space, or within range of a melee weapon that the enemy 
has equipped, and when performing a skill check when in melee combat.
Melee combat is relatively simple. To hit an enemy player, add your dexterity 
modifier to a d100 roll, plus any relevant skill. The result must be 
greater than the opponent''s DEX * 5 + any skill in combat (Guard DC). Your 
damage dealt is based on a combination of your DEX and STR modifier. If you 
are wielding a weapon against an unarmed opponent, they may still incur damage
depending on their skill.

A character may grapple another character when they are both in melee 
distance. Doing so provides the grappled player a "penalty attack" on the 
grappling player. During grappling, both sides roll opposing grapple checks to 
see who maintains control. Once you have control you may make a grapple check 
to subdue your opponent (by choke-out, pin, or a joint lock). You may also strike
an opponent during grappling, but if the strike fails your opponent may attempt 
to gain control of the grapple. Skill in grappling is different than skill in 
unarmed combat.
Instead of dealing full damage, a character can try to kick/shove a human sized
opponent to force movement by rolling for a normal unarmed attack with a -2
miss penalty. If the attack succeeds, it yields 1/2 the damage it normally 
would and pushes the target 1m for every 5 strength you have.

Actions:
During combat, your character has 4 Actions. Actions are used for fighting, 
movement, items, whimpering, etc. Here is a table of common tasks and their
relative cost:

Reloading a Pump-Action Shotgun - 4 Actions
Reloading a Bolt-Action Weapon - 3 Actions
Reloading a Magazine Fed Weapon - 2 Actions
Moving DEX # of Meters - 2 Actions
Hunkering Down - 1 Action
Firing a Semi-Auto Gun - 1 Action
Suppressing an Area/Target - 1 Action
Cast a Spell - 1 Action
Aiming Down Gun Sights - 1 Action
Turning on a Flashlight - 1 Action
Unholstering Pistol or Grabbing a Weapon/Item - 1 Action
Performing a Skill Check (other than Awareness/Perception) - 1 Action
Conversing With Partners - Free Action
Getting Your Bearings / Non Skill-Based Perception - Free Action

Movement:
You can run DEX number of meters per 2 actions. A character with 1 DEX can 
move 1m per 2 actions, or 2m per 4 actions (a full turn). You can sprint 
instead of running, for a +2 movement bonus per two actions. However,
firing your weapon after doing so will cause you to incur a +1 miss chance
penalty. The penalty occurs during the actions you sprint, as well as 2 actions 
afterwards. You can sprint for a number of subsequent Actions equal to your Fortitude.
You can jump horizontally Dex/2 meters, and add 1 meter if you have a 3 meter 
running start.
You can jump vertically Str/3 meters.

Fighting:
If a player or opponent is standing outside of cover and they are shot at, 
after the first firing action (assuming they didn't die or go unconscious), 
they immediately, 'Hit the Dirt'. When you Hit the Dirt, you dive to the ground,
going prone, within a 2m range of where they stood (DEX movement rules apply 
as normal). Hitting the dirt consumes the 1st action of their next turn.

During combat with a ranged weapon, you can aim and fire or, more simply, just fire
at a target. If you shoot without aiming, you are "Hip Firing" and incur additional
aiming penalties (see Hip Firing, below).
Most weapons are Semi-Auto, meaning that each time you pull the 
trigger, the gun fires once and chambers a new round automatically. It 
takes 1 Action to fire a semi-auto weapon in this way. Some guns, 
such as Shotguns and Bolt-Action sniper rifles require 2 Actions to fire 
the gun, where the first Action is a trigger pull, and the second Action
is the rechambering of the weapon.
To hit a target, Players must roll a d10 that is over their weapon's miss stat.
When an enemy is in cover, their cover score is added to your weapon's miss chance. 
Lets say your normal ranged miss chance is 2, and the enemy is in full cover, your
miss chance is increased by 4, for a final DC of 6. So a roll of 7-10 would be 
successful.

Critical Hits:
Critical hits are accuracy rolls that land inside your critical hit range (aka. crit chance). 
If you roll a critical hit, your weapon does +20 damage for that attack (and/or other effects,
depending on your abilities). By default, everyone starts with a critical hit range of "1", meaning, an
attack roll of a 10 would be considered a critical hit. But your critical range may 
not be "1" because your Luck modifies your critical hit range: ((Luck-5)*0.4), round up, is
added to your critical hit range. Which means, if you have a Luck stat of 6 (and thus,
by the equation, +1 to your critical hit range), an attack roll of 9-10 would be considered
a critical hit. 
All weapons and melee can critical hit except for Fully-Automatic weapons (weapons that 
shoot more than 1 bullet per Action by default).

Gun Jams:
If at any time that you are firing a gun and you roll a weapon accuracy of 1, roll a second d10.
If that second d10 roll is a 1 or 2, the weapon Jams, necessitating a weapon 
skill check, DC 60. 

Armor and Getting Hit:
When a player is defending against a successful enemy hit, they roll Percentiles under their 
armor in order to see if their armor blocked the bullet, and from there, how much
damage they receive. If the defending player has no armor, they armor roll for a target 50 Percentile. 
If the armor roll is above 50%, they receive half-damage. Below 50%, full damage.

Armor consists of 3 concepts: Armor Points (APs), Armor Piercing level (APL), and % Coverage.
Starting from the end, Coverage is simply the percentile that you have to roll
under to see if armor was hit. If the attack misses armor, or rolls over 50%, it does
half damage because the bullet is hitting a less vital part of the body. If the attack
hits armor: Armor Piercing level (APL) comes into play. 
	APL is a unitless number that represents how well a weapon can pierce armor or
how well armor can block bullets. If the attackers weapon's APL is less than the
defenders armor's APL, all damage is blocked. If the weapon's APL is greater than
or equal to the armor's APL, then Armor Points (APs) come into play. 
	APs are, effectively, your armor's ability to slow down projectiles as they
pass through it. Whenever armor is successfully pierced, all damage is first inflicted
on APs. Once the APs are used up, all remaining damage goes to health. APs refresh at the
start of the armor wearer's turn.

Hip Firing:
Add 3 to a weapon''s miss chance. You cannot use attachments to assist in
hip firing unless otherwise noted. It is much smarter to takes one 
action to Aim, and spend the rest of your shots firing. It's also a great 
idea to take an action at the end of your turn to "hunker," and gain a +2 

cover advantage.
If your weapon has a minimum distance (usually because of a high-powered
scope), and you fire inside that distance, you are forced to hip fire.

Blind Firing:
Add 6 to a weapon's miss chance. Blind firing allows you to shoot around cover
without looking or putting yourself at risk. Your blind fire accuracy is affected 
by your base weapon miss chance(s), not affected by regular attachments, and only 
reduced by LUCK and PER mod (max of -4 miss chance from LUCK mod + PER combat mod).

Using Cover/Stances:
Chances are, if an enemy can see you in Compund X, they can hit you. Using 
cover will make you harder to be hit. You will encounter many types of cover 
while adventuring throughout the galaxy. Many small objects provide only 
partial cover, either by partially obscuring your silhouette, or by providing 
slight protection from projectiles. Full cover will do both to a better 
degree. Crouching or going prone will also take better advantage of your surroundings
and make you a smaller target. Debuffs to enemies Miss Chance are as follows:

No Cover: +0
Partial Cover: +2 
Full Cover: +4

Crouching: +1 (on top of whatever cover you''re behind.)
Prone: +2 (on top of whatever cover you''re behind, may completely obscure vision)
Hunkering: +2 (on top of whatever cover you''re behind.)

Crouching is a free action, and standing up costs 1 Action. While you are
crouched, you have -1 movement speed per action (minimum 1) and you cannot
sprint or use other movement abilities.
	Going prone costs 1 Action, and standing up costs 1 Action. Lying flat down on
your chest makes you a smaller target and helps you aim better, but also makes you
easier to hit in melee. -0.5 gun miss chance while prone and +2 chance to be hit in
melee. Being prone severely limits your movement: 1/2 movement speed while prone, 
round-up; maximum 4 movement per 2 actions.
	Hunkering costs 1 action, and you cannot fire your weapons. Imagine 
curling up in a ball, to pose the absolute smallest target possible. Its a 
free action to un-hunker

Stealth Attacks:
If you are stealthed (undetected by an opponent) when you initiate an attack
action, you incur bonuses depending on the circumstances of the attack.
	Ranged weapon stealth-attacks (including explosive but not any other thrown 
weapons) have -1 miss chance to hit., if 'adequate' aiming time is given (DM's discretion:
how rushed you are, or how skilled you are at stealth, etc). Ranged weapon stealth-
attacks deal +20 damage and, in addition, if you critical hit you gain all the effects 
of a critical.
	If you have 10 skill in melee combat, Thrown and Melee (non-explosive) weapons
deal 2x damage, up to 150 maximum damage (before critical effects). If you critically
hit, or hit at greater than 3 over your miss chance, the target gets hit in whatever you
deem to be the most vulnerable; i.e., the head, neck, or the chest (over the heart,
etc). If you critical hit, you also gain all the effects of a critical.

Suppression: 
Every player with a ranged weapon gets the option to Suppress as the last 
action of their turn. Suppression, also known as, "laying down fire", 
"covering fire", or "suppressive fire" is the art of shooting a hail of 
bullets (as accurately as possible) to try and prevent the enemy from 
effectively fighting back while your team maneuvers. Suppression comes in
three flavors: light, medium, and heavy; these indicate how wide of an area
is suppressed as well as how effective that suppression is (defined below).
The type of suppression available to you is dependent on your weapon.

When you Suppress, you aim at the target as part of the action and fire a
hail of bullets (within your weapon range). Suppression doesn't require any
rolls to initiate, the suppressor simply fires, creating a light/medium/heavy
suppression AOE (Area-of-Effect, typically a 1-3m circle).
If a suppressed target moves out into the open**, they trigger automatic attack
rolls (or automatic hits) by the suppressor, once per target per suppressor's 
turn. If the suppressed target shoots, they fire with +1 miss chance, not-stackable.
Suppression status can't be purged unless you move outside the AOE. 
The only other way to stop being suppressed is to stop the suppressor from 
using a suppression action on you at the end of their turn.

Light Suppression:
	As the last action of your turn, aim at a target and fire 3 rounds (or the rest
	of your magazine, at least 1 round has to be fired) to suppress 1m radius AOE around
	the target. The target takes a +1 miss chance malus until the start of your next turn, 
	and if the target moves out into the open**, then roll an immediate reaction to hit the 
	target with a (non-automatic fire) accuracy roll. Immediate reactions are stackable on a
	per-weapon basis.
Medium/Moderate Suppression:
	identical to light suppression with the following exceptions, you must fire 6 rounds
	from the current magazine to achieve 'moderate', and you don't have to roll to hit -- you 
	automatically hit and roll armor.
Heavy Suppression:
	identical to light suppression with the following exceptions: you must fire 10 rounds
	from the current magazine to achieve 'heavy', you don't have to roll to hit -- you 
	automatically hit x2 and roll for armor. You suppress all targets within a 2m radius 
	AOE around the primary target.

**"Moving out into the open" includes moving into a new location while you can
be hit by shots from the suppressor (this excludes moving into complete concealment,
such as going prone behind a high concrete wall). For example, the following situations
would trigger a free hit by the suppressor and give you the 'suppressed' status
while remaining in the area (let's assume you are upright (not crouched or prone)):
moving from partial cover to an adjacent partial cover, moving from complete concealment
behind a barricade to partial cover, and moving when you are caught out in the open.
	If the suppressor cannot physically hit you (such as being completely behind an 
impenetrable barrier) you are not suppressed. The suppressor doesn't need to see 
you, to hit you.

Reloading:
When a gun runs out of ammunition, the user must pause to reload. "But how long 
do I gotta be outta the battle?" Great question!
Each gun has a "Reload DC," rated based on the skill and brevity of the 
weapon''s reload. For example, an assault rifle, which has a very obvious 
magazine release button and protruding magazine, has an average DC of 30%. More 
complex weapons, such as high-precision sniper systems or exotic sub-machine 
guns might have a higher DC, maybe 40%. If the Player passes the reload, then 
the reload time is standard. For Box-Magazine fed Semi- and Fully-Automatic 
weapons, this is 2 Actions. Other, more complex weapons will specify their 
reload time. On a critical reload success (effected by luck as normal, anything 
in the 90-100 range caused by a raw roll or by adding your weapon use skill),
the reload time is halved (for Bolt-Actions it is reduced to 1 Action). On a 
failure, the reload time takes twice as long.

When players take more than 70 damage, they must roll a Shock save at a DC of 
the damage taken. On fail they pass out. on success they stay conscious. When 
players fail, they may roll each turn at a DC of 70 to wake up. They continue 
to roll either for (15 - FORT) turns, or until they pass.

Conditions:
Bleeding - d10/2+1 (drop the remainder) stackable damage per turn. Broken with 
Medicine Skill check. DC varies. If you have a bleed condition, seek medical aid
immediately, You can Bleed Out.
Burning - 2d10 damage per turn. Broken with a Maneuver Skill Check. DC 40. 
Every 2 turns, the degree of the burn intensifies
Downed - Your health has fallen below 0. Every turn in this condition, you 
must pass a DC 70 Fort save. You are allowed a number of failures equal to 
your Fort score, for your lifespan. when you have failed more times than 
your Fort score, you die. While in this state, you cannot take any actions,
but can mumble or speak 
incomprehensibly.
Frozen - d10 damage per turn. lasts until a source of heat is applied to the 
wound, or with Medicine Skill check, DC 50
Fear - No actions, except running away form the source of fear, or rolling to 
defeat fear. DC 50, Will save.
Fear, Greater - No actions, except rolling to defeat fear. DC 75, Will save.
Necrosis - 2d10 +5 damage per turn. Seek medical attention immediately. If 
left unhealed for more than a day, the infection spreads 1 foot per day. 
Medicine DC 75, must be rolled.
Pinned Down - Target pinned (hunkered, no movement) for 2 full turns or until they 
pass a Will saving throw at DC of 70, whichever is quicker.
Plasma Burn - 1d10+1 stackable damage per turn, for 2 turns if the target's armor
is pierced/missed. If the targets armor is hit/pierced, the armor's AP level is 
reduced by 1, permanently (repairable, DC 60% Repair check), not stackable. 
Poisoned - d10 damage per turn. After 5 turns, some poisons may induce 
unconsciousness. DC 50, Fortitude. Greater / Lesser poison increases damage 
(+5/-5) and DC (+25,-10).

==============================
Damage Types and armor types
==============================

There are 5 main types of damage in compound X: Ballistic (conventional firearms, bows),
Laser, Plasma, Explosive (concussive), and melee. Additionally, some Ballistic, Laser, and 
melee weapons can deal non-lethal variants. These damage types interact differently with 
the two types of protection: Armor and Shields. 

Ballistic Weapons:
	Ballistic weapons are straightforward: they are blocked by armor and ignore shields.
	Any damage that defeats armor damages health.
Plasma Weapons:
	Plasma interacts with both armor and shields. Armor's effectiveness is reduced by 
	1 APL when hit by plasma. Targets hit with plasma, that pierces armor, take (stackable) 
	plasma burn. For Shields, Plasma deals half damage to the shielding, plus inflicts plasma
	burn and any remaining damage on the wearer (only if their armor is pierced, of course). 
Laser Weapons:
	Lasers are completely blocked by shields, dealing all of their damage to the shielding.
	Lasers deal full damage to armored targets; If a player wearing ballistic armor is hit 
	with a laser, they receive damage as if they weren't wearing any armor.
Explosives:
	Certain grenades and devices have Explosive (concussive) damage. Explosive Damage ignores
	armor and shields (explosive damage is essentially, a crushing force). Fragmentation 
	grenades are considered ballistic weapons, as their primary damage delivery method is shrapnel. 
Melee/Melee Weapons:
	Melee damage is treated like ballistic damage.
Armor:
	Ballistic Armors (or more simply, Armor) are the first type of protective measure that 
	you will come across. When armor is shot by a ballistic weapon, the armor may reduce or
	fully block damage before the character's health is damaged. 
Shields:
	CS Shields (or more simply, Shields) are the second type of protective measure that you
	will come across. Shields normally protect against Plasma and Lasers but not against ballistics.  

Beyond weapon damage, there are also environmental threats to consider. An 
important note is on fall damage. A player can fall up to their Dex/2 in 
meters before needing to roll an acrobatics check. If the surface they are 
landing on is somehow fouled, the GM may require the player to roll an 
acrobatics check when landing from any height at their discretion. On a failed 
roll, take damage equal to 2 times the height fallen. The player also incurs 
one injury, depending on the severity of the fall. Some examples are below:
    Sprained ankle(s)
    Broken ankle(s)
    Broken leg(s)
    Broken arm(s) in addition to leg(s)
    Broken everything

==============================
Casting Spells
==============================

There are a few classes which are able to cast spells, Paladins, Mages and 
Sorcerers. Casting spells is very similar to performing other actions. 
Normally, a spell takes one action to cast. The performer of the spell will 
have to pass a Skill DC in order to successfully cast the spell. This DC is 
the number of Nanites used to cast the spell, plus an bonuses the target gains 
from cover. For Mages and Sorcerers this is a Spellcast DC, and for Paladins 
this is a Knowledge [Nanites] DC. Mages/Sorcerers can add any skill points 
they have in Sorcery to their rolls, and Paladins may do the same with their 
Knowledge [Nanites] skill. Some spells may also require the target to make a 
saving throw in order to avoid the spell or negate its effects. Generally 
speaking, spells have a range that is dependant on either the Charisma score 
of the caster or the Charisma Modifier.

==============================
Cloaking
==============================

Cloaking is available in the armor section, but also available to some 
classes as a class feature. For non-class cloakers, the rules are as follows:
Expend 50 Nanites to activate the cloaking shield. while moving, the cloak DC 
is 30. while staying still, the cloak DC is 60. There is a tell-tale shimmer 
in the cloak, as the micro-foil has a hard time keeping up with moving 
environments. Once the wearer has settled down, the micro-foil is able to 
reproduce the surrounding environment better and will stabilize. However, once 
you have performed a combat action, the cloak fizzes out, as you have shifted 
your concentration from maintaining the cloak to something else. When using a 
skill (accessing a terminal, fixing something, etc.) your DC is 30, as you are 
diverting your attention. See the following table for durations:
