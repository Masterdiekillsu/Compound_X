//Devnotes
Generic plasma shotgun. generated offline without access to price tool. 
Personality is expensive, glowing and should be one of the most efficient ways for a
player to disperse plasma at close range. Xenon is a nobel gas sometimes excited 
to plasma state for use in Neon-like signs. ('cause it's a different color)
devnotes will not be pushed to play branch
//Taylor's notes
I''ve changed it to Neon. I''ve written up in the GM Munition Info doc that the different types of noble gasses produced different densities of plasma. Heavier element plasmas deal more plasma burn tokens. Since this is supposed to be a basic plasma shotgun, Neon would make sense.

//needs reworking; no such round currently exists and the damage is too high for that sort of range. Generally damage scales with range, faster rounds carry more force so they not only travel farther, they hit with greater impact when they arrive at the target.
