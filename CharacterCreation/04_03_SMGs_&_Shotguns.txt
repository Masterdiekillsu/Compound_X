SHOTGUNS
==============================
    All pump shotguns take 1 Action to fire, 1 Action to rack. In the 
racking action, you can load an additional round of your specification for one
additional action. Double barrel, semi, and auto shotguns do not follow this rule.
Slug damage deals damage as a normal rifle would, dealing its full damage up 
to the weapons maximum range. Buck-Shot damage is typically different at 2 distinct distances,
which are listed with the weapon in question.
Minimum Strength 4. Reload time is 3 Actions unless weapon is mag-fed. If Mag-fed, 
reload time is 2 Actions.

- All Shotguns have "Suppression Level - Light" (unless otherwise noted).
