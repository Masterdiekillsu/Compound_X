ECSC Class-A Security Drone
==============================

    Security Drones are specialized drones that have been granted a greater AI 
capacity to learn and think independently. They are native to ECSC Compound X 
experimentation laboratory.

===== Appearance/Anatomy ===== 

    Built specifically for security and military counterparts, as their name suggests,
Class-A Security Drones have a steel reinforced frame, with a built-in modular 
armor rig. The coloration of plating can range anywhere in the natural colors and 
camouflages, to the standard ECSC Matte Grey. 

    They are considered a Large species, as the standard models are over 6â€™ tall and
weight between 400 and 700 lbs. 

    When fully-armored, these drones are very difficult to gain physical access 
to. Negating or destroying armor plates only makes the interior workings easier 
to get to. Underneath their armor, drones have another weak carapace that is 
defensively analogous to human skin. 

    There are two main panels/access points on these drones. The first is the on 
the head, containing the polycrystaline AI matrix, ocular sensor housing and 
wireless network interface stack. The second is on the chest. It contains the 
locomotive manifold, micro-fission reactor and coolant system. 

===== Society =====

    Built by the ECSC Compound X experimentation laboratory, Detachment A 
Security Drones have an AI greater than their B and C counterparts. Their 
programming has enough flaws to be susceptible to hacking, but is advanced 
enough to spark debate bout sentience and rights.


Types: 
*  Mechanical
*  Independant AI
*  Nuclear Fission Core
*  Magnetic Induction

===== Language: Various ===== 

    As Natives to the ECSC, Security Drones speak Terran Common by default. 
Drones specifically manufactured to work with certain people groups will also 
speak the regional language. For instance, a Drone to be sent to Hera, where the 
primary spoken language is Mandar, would therefore be outfitted with a Mandar 
language database.

Passives: 

*  Immune to Poison.
*  Immune to Intoxication.
*  Weakness to Electrical: Electrical damage deals an additional 50% damage.

===== Available Traits ===== 

Built-in armor:
    As an ECSC-manufactured drone, you have the ability to use the ECSC 
specialty drone armor sets.[Access to ECSC Special Drone Armor]

Inhuman Strength:
    Built specifically for lifting and holing great weights, you are far 
stronger than your biological counterparts. Your systems store excess energy in
your nanite pool, which you can direct and discharge when the situation demands 
it. Any time you make a Strength or Athletics(STR) check, you may pay 10 nanites 
before you roll to give yourself a +10 bonus to the roll.
