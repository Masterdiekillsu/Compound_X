==============================
Backgrounds
==============================
	Where is your character from? Maybe they grew up on a kangaroo farm, or studied medicine on a core planet. Were they trained for corporate espionage or recruited for military service? From smuggling contraband, to piloting cargo ships, to making appointments for a corporate executive, a character's past will inform how they act under pressure, react under fire and interact with teammates.
	How did your character learn to fight? Did they spend their childhood knocking heads with local fauna? Perhaps they graduated from boot camp or a corporate academy. Maybe they were taught by the school of hard knocks, fighting to survive on the fringes of society.
	In addition to influencing your character's decisionmaking and roleplay, their background also gives them knowledge and experience. As you build your character, choose specific scenarios in which your character has an edge over others due to their upbringing, history and education. These elements of your character's experience will provide bonuses to their rolls in-game.
	Formal backgrounds in Compound X have three parts: a character's culture of origin, their career and education, and their central driving goal or value.
