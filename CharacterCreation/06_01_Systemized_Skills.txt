*Gives half the bonus a specific will give on a check.

	Suggested that certain classes can gain skill in their proficiency 
area twice as quickly, so every point you spend from leveling up is doubled 
up in that skill.

	Suggest cap of 60. Adding Specific modifier to to skill. For 
example, Attribute of 10 = 20 mod. This gives a max of +80 to a skill 
check. In theory a 180 could be rolled. This is very rare.

	Currently there are no rules for a critical success on skill checks 
in the listing. I would suggest a 10 bonus for regular critical, and a 20 
bonus for extra critical (Name change suggestion to Supreme Critical. Extra 
sounds like it’s a bonus sauce. SUPREME makes it sound like the full 
frigging 5 course meal). This gives us a possible maximum of 200.

== More reasonable DC for things ==
Example for (STRENGTH) Athletics check: 
* 25 = Easy (Doing a pull-up)
* 50 = Simple (Climbing a tree)
* 75 = Moderate (Kicking down a door)
* 100 = Hard (Running through a wooden wall)
* 125 = Difficult (Kicking down a reinforced door)
* 150 = Improbable (Throwing a human through a reinforced door)
* 175 = Inconceivable (Ripping a reinforced door off its hinges with 
	your hands and hitting someone with it like a baseball game)
* 200 = Impossible (Opening an airlock with your bear-hands)

	Rationale, allowing certain classes to gain up to double that score 
in certain areas. INT of (avg5)*(2)*(level10) = 100 known. Max = 200 known

	For example: Soldiers can get various Weapon specializations, Berserker 
can get Weapons - Melee (instead of unarmed expert because they do in fact have 
a weapon in most cases) etc. See Suggested list below

	Also took out the word Use from things. Added a - to specify specifi

===== Class Skill Proficiency =====

Adept: Knowledge - Nanites, Weapons - General
	New Name. I like Tech Trooper.
	
Assassin: Stealth, Weapons - Melee
Berserker: Athletics, Weapons - Melee
	Typo in class description name, need to get that first r in there
	
Engineer: Knowledge - [General], Repair
Doctor: Knowledge - [Any], Medical
Gunslinger: Acrobatics, Weapons - Pistol
Hacker: Knowledge - Nanites, Knowledge - Systems
	Suggested removing nanites from this tree, it doesn’t make a ton of 
sense to me for a hacker to use nanites to buff allies now that we have 
removed them from the bloodstream. Perhaps they buff any tech the ally has, 
for like giving them auto aim on a rifle or giving a bonus to any check they 
use with technology. Honestly I think this subclass needs some rework now 
that nanites are no longer in the bloodstream. Unless you want this to be 
a subclass that does put nanites into thing’s blood. In the case that it 
does get removed, recommended Knowledge - Any or a Hacking skill if that 
is the case.
