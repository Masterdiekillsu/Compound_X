Hunter's Dog Rules and Stats
==============================


===== Dog Rules =====

    The Dog cannot use weapons, armor nor non-food items. 

    The Dog is smaller than most combatants and moves very quickly. If the Dog 
moved at least 8m on their last turn, they are considered to be in partial cover
from all angles. 

    The Dog has no guard in melee. Instead, up to four times per round the dog 
may roll a reflex save of DC 70 to dodge a melee attack.

    The Dog has a +(level x 5) bonus to investigate and awareness checks that 
they can use their sense of smell to help with. 

    The Dog can use tricks like "lay down," "shake," "fetch," or "chase your 
tail" to charm or distract characters in the area. When they do, the target must
succeed on a Will save opposed by the dog's Charisma (+12) performance roll.

    The Dog's primary weapon is their bite. Their melee roll is 
6 + (level/4) + roll. On a successful hit, the target is grappled with the Dog
in control. Every time the Dog makes a melee attack while it is in control of a
grapple, it deals 60 damage. 

===== Notes on Role-Playing A Dog =====

== Projecting ==

In testing, we have found that players who love animals (sometimes beloved 
animals who have passed on) sometimes play a hunter in order to project complex
feelings onto their pretend pet as catharsis. This may lead to unforeseen hurt
feelings if the pretend pet is damaged, killed or is interacted with in an way
that the player didn't expect during role play. It is left as a choice between
the DM and the player if this kind of play is encouraged or discouraged. We do
however strongly recommend having a discussion between the DM and that player 
about cognitive projection prior to playing a Hunter with a dog.
