Opalietes
==============================

===== Society =====

The Opaleites are one of the discordant societies that the Terrans have come
across so far. Moving from Trioch II to Trioch IV briefly united the clans 
to save their species, but rapidly descended back into infighting. The clans 
are heavily separated by subspecies, primarily informed by diet. However, many 
of the subspecies within food groups do not agree either. 

They are primarily a clan-based society. There is more emphasis on being a part
of your

===== Languages: Various =====

All Opaleite languages follow a similar vocal pattern structure, but dialects
vary greatly enough that some schools struggle to understand each other.

Vocal - Underwater
  This portion of the language is meant exclusively for long-range communication
  underwater. It features series of clicks, whistles, and song-like long tones to
  covery general ideas, locations, and strategies.

Vocal - Above Water
  Very similar to the speech used by many other sentient species, Opaleites have
  a tonal vocalized language that is used to communicate above water. This aspect
  of their communication is much more suited to exploring and explaining complex
  thoughts, feelings, and plans.
  It is sing-song both above and beneath the water, but the sounds are often
  harsh-sounding to an ear accustomed to Terran-based Common.

Signing - Above & Below  
  Commonly used beneath the water, hand signing and fin signals help convey 
  complex ideas in near-silence underwater. Many schools have their own versions
  of this method of communication, making it easy to talk amongst themselves
  while in mixed company.

Other
  Some schools of Opaleites have additional ways of communicating. These
  are often non-verbal, having to do with that school's specific anatomy.
  Colorchanging and Bioluminescence are two examples of this.
