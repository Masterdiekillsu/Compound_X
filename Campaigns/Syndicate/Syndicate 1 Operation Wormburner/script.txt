Your squad transfers to the ECSC Holder for a flyby patrol of New Shikoku, a planet that was terraformed by the Sakai Corporation. <embelish here a bit>

Upon ariving to the planet, the team is informed of a hot call, and are instructed to proceed imediatley to the drop pods, they'll be briefed as they breach the atmosphere. It turns out that Sakai Security forces have found the bomber who destroyed Potto-otto (in the tutorial mission). Your squad's mission is to bring the bomber (code name: Kalihan) in dead or alive.

===================================First encounter: pinned down security forces ============

A firefight rages as the insurgent forces struggle to disengage from Sakai Security and the new ECSC forces. When the tide of the battle turns in the good guys' favor, Kalihan and the remaining forges will retreat in one or two technicles leaving two slightly damaged technicles behind. Kalihan has a sheild that is secretly permanent until the final encounter.

To follow, the players must find a way to fix the technicals with a mechanist, pilot, or some other hair-brained scheme. If they are really convincing, and the constable survived, he can repair one technical to run at half speed. As the players leave the compound, they come to a fork in the road. A tracking or intuition skill should be rolled. on a 25 or higher, the players note fresh tire tracks heading stright/left. If no tracking is rolled, or the roll fails, they note tire tracks that go down both roads, as both roads get used fairly regularly. Going straight/left leads to option A below. Going right leads to option B. Exploring the woods might lead to a wind generator in the middle which makes for a great sniping position. Also, there's ziplines that can let the players move into the seperate options. 

oportunity objective: 
save the wounded Constable winston, who has been hit by insurgent SMG fire. He's slipping in and out of conciousness. He can be stabalized with either a healing check DC 50 or at least medicine 10 and a DC of 30. If healed, he either gives a story easter egg, or a clip of shredder rounds from his private stash as a thank you.

easter egg: 
weapons cache in the tent
holds three clips of shredder ammo for whomever deserves it. Adjust ammo type on-the-fly. Most military weapons take 5.56, pistols take 9mm or 10mm depending. 



=================== Second encounter, option A: The firefight at the makeshift camp========
deliver on the power fantasy. Straight firefight. Again Kalihan bugs out, using the firefight to put distance between the players and him as he tries to make his escape. The insurgents in this camp attack on sight and will fight to the death to defend their raiding operation. 

Easter egg: 
Laptop on table
stolen laptop opened with pasword combo that could be given by officer Winston, or hacked with a hacking skill min of 10 and DC 30.  Gives two emails, one talking about the op that these insurgents went on to splice into the settler's power grid up at the windmill, the other talks about the sweet new shredder rounds in the red box nearby. See rewards doc for details on shredder rounds. 

Easter egg:
Red crate
contains mystery rounds for whatever gun is held by the person who finds them. Box is in japanese, so players can't tell what the rounds do without a skill check, or by cracking the nearby computer. They're shredder rounds. 

Easter egg:
computer by yellow crates
Hacking skill 30 required. DC 70. 
Actionable intel on enemy suply routes. ECSC requisitions gives significant support points for the find. Send to handler for cash in. 

Easter egg:
locked safe on top of red barrels.
Lockpick 15 required. DC 40.
Contains orders from Kalihan discussing payment for housing him at this base while he assembles the bomb in the truck. No questions are to be asked of Kalihan while he's here, and he is to be brought black tea and an MRE three times a day while he works. 
Also contains a single mag of mystery rounds that are labled in Araibic. They are gluon rounds. 

=============Second encounter, option B: the Rigistruct settlers ==================
If the team doesn't check their targets and instead shoots at anything that moves, the little kid grabs a fallen parent's SMG or AR and will fight to the death to kill the players. Once the players have massacred the town, the handler calls to figure out what happened. The handler is horrified to find out that the team just killed X number of civilians, and begins to try to plan a cover-up. 

If the team does check their targets, they find that the Rigistruct settlers are friendly, but they have assault weapons and extra magazines, which is technically illegal on this continent. If the player confronts the town leader about this, the town leader says that they've been having problems with insurgents, and he needs the ammo to protect his family. The player can confinscate the mags (gets 3 extended mags for carbine, assault rifle and/or SMGs at the GM's discression) or let the man keep them. If the player lets the man keep the mags, the man explains that he arranged to get a delivery under the table from a friend, but he doesn't want to get in trouble if the troops check around the place. He takes an RPG with a single shot out from a smuggler's hidey-hole and gives it to the players. 

Easter Egg:

Lockpick 10 required. DC 60. Safe contains .

Easter Egg:
Weapons stash in the first tent

==================Optional encounter: ambush on the way to the final battle ===============
feel free to omit this if you have a new group, low on time, or this is the team's first 
play through.

WARNING: this encounter is not currently in place!

=============== Final encounter: show down at the launch pad ======================

Kalihan parks his technical about halfway between the enterance and his escape ship. Kalihan will return fire as the opportunity arrises. He has a daily retaliate feat which lets him shoot his pistol once at a player character if they are putting too much pressure on him instead of the other inssurgents around him. If it looks like kalihan's team is losing, he will retreat for his ship, which takes four turns to warm up and take off. If the team boards the ship, it is a CQB situation where only CQB or melee weapons can be used.

If Kalihan is killed, an intelligence gathering check of 40 or higher will find evidence on board that furthers the story. 

The medic by the brown crates will alternate tactics between tending the wounded and maneuvering for shots on the player characters.


If Kalihan is taken alive and interrogated on the ground, he tries to comit suicide. He will only make indirect references to The Syndicate. He evades and talks tough. He's convinced that there's nothing that the players have that he wants. He's a professional; he's conducted interrogations before. He knows the drill. He just wants to die. If take to Holder, Vimi Vindalay will eventually crack him, leading to the next mission.   

Easter egg:
Wraith dropship
if a player has hacking level 40 and passes a DC 70 hack attempt, they can highjack the dropship and keep it. It has locked countermeasures as stealth, reduced armor, increased handling and an accurate laser chin gun. Pilot sill must be 15 to fly.
