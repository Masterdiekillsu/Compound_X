//Intro

The group starts aboard a civilian transport ship, the Jewel of Kzalka, which has seen much better days. It is tasked with taking people from one of the outer-rim colonies to worlds closer to the ECSC core, away from the war. All sorts can be found on ships such as these, from the poor craftsman hoping to find a better life in more stable conditions, to the expert mercenary, looking to offer their services in a region whose main fighting body has left to defend the Empire.

This ship is divided into three main regions, Main Storage / Habitation, Crew Decks, and Engine & Maintenance. The group starts in the habitation region, in the middle of the ship. There are three very large hangers that rotate around a central pillar that connects the front to the rear of the ship.

At the back of this section, built into the central collumn but not quite a part of the rear engine region, are landing / transfer ships used to ferry crew or passengers to planets or other ships when a large ship dock is not available.

The group starts in Hangar 1. It is an area about the sie of 2 large football fields. There are rudamentary "lodgings" built up inside. It is clear that his ship is a repurposed deep-space freighter, as the lodgings are made of old shipping containers.

Guards limit access in and out of the bay during transit. The Crew and Engine regions are strictly off limits, and offenders are punished to the full extent of the law. Usually this means getting thrown in the brig and off-worlded at the ships'' nearest convenience.

This is where the GM leaves the players. They are independant at this point, free to explore the ship for a few in game minutes to an hour. Unbeknownst to the players, the transport ship is heading into a trap set up by an atelsikor scouting party. The civilian ship is not only transporting people, there is a very old piece of cargo attached to it, a relic being brought in to Mars base for inspection.

Regardless of what the players do in the next 20 minutes of play time, The ship makes a sudden turn, mildly discernable. Soon after a voice is heard on an intercom
"All crew, report to emergency sectors. Brace for contact."

A few of the guards begin entering the crowd, calling for calm and for all passengers to pack their essentials and stay in their quarters.

Outside the hangars, crew are rushing to various parts of the ship. As long as you stay out of their way, they might be too busy to notice you . . . 

An explosion rocks the ship somewhere towards the rear. The passengers are starting to panick a little at this point and are getting restless. Even the guards, who are not front-line soldiers, are looking uneasy.

"Security personell please escort passengers to boarding craft for evacuation"

A series of clunks can be heard up and down the ship, followed by a loud buzzing.

The enemy is now on the ship. Any party members that decide they want to investigate these strange interlopers find them to be 6 foot tall and covered in a dull blackish brown suit of sorts. They weild foreign looking weapons and do not vocally communicate. They do, however, launch volleys of orangeish plasma which eats through cover and armour alike.

The group comes accross a guard fighting with one of the aliens hand to hand. The enemy draws some kind of spike and advances on the guard. If the group rescues the guard, he decides to tell the players that one of the boarding ships is locked by a special encryption, with a key that only he knows. If they go with him they are guarenteed passage off of the ship.

If the party decides to leave without helping the guard, or decline his offer of a ship, they must roll a group luck DC, 75*# in the group. If they pass, they find a pod waiting for them, if they fail, they can explore other options, perhaps that stranger?

At any rate, the players are more or less going to end up teaming up with the guard. Once they find some means of transport together, he reveals he isn''t an employee of the transport agency. He doesn''t go into too much detail, but explains that the ship was carrying other cargo and that humans make for good camaflage. As the group leaves the ship behind, it is rocked with multiple explosions as plasma hails down on it from a sinister looking grey and brown spiked mass floating on the other side. Lucky for our group they left opposite it, or they may have met a rather warm fate.

Before the ship succumbs to its damage, a different looking flash catches the eyes of the group [DC 60 Spot] and another pod is seen. It rapidly advances on the group''s pod, and as it passes them, blue light fills the cabin of the pod. Each member of the group makes a Fort save, DC 60. Those that fall unconcious have a vison of the inside of a tank.

The Transport ship begins to dissassemble under the barrage of plasma, and a bright flash is followed by liquified metal hurled in all directions as the reactor goes critical.

Now the group is faced with a challenge. How do they land on the strange blu and green planet below them without dying?
