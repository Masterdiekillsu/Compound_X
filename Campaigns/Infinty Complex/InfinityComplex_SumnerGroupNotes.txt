//==============================
// Session One: Welcome Party
//==============================
	The ship carrying the players was attacked by an unknown group of powerful-tech users. Facing a large number of enemy soldiers in the main hangar, the group withdrew to a ide elevator to escape.

//==============================
// Session Two: Landfall
//==============================
	Plans: Upon exiting the turbo-lift, the group faces a struggle between one of the agressors and a man clad in a guard''s uniform. He is more heavily armored and there is a very custom looking weapon lying on the ground out of his reach. The attacker is advancing on him, back to the players, with a long, stilletto-like blade.

	Players find their way to a pod or ship o escape the freighter. After some awkward flighttime, they crash land on a nearby planet. Here they must decide where to go. If Ramon is with them, he will inform them that he has business to attend to to the west, and leave the party. Before he leaves he''ll suggest that the players head North towards the reckage to see if there are any survivors. He mentions that there likely won''t be rescue off of this planet for a while, as it is an uncharted and unsettled planet in the outer-rim.

	3 DC 60 Survival checks to be made, players will continue wandering the wilderness until they are all made. Players get to make 3 checks per day. Th e players start with 2 days of survival rations each (poor rations). They can boost these by making Survival or Tracking checks (Hunting) or Awareness checks (Gathering).
	In order to hunt to feed everyone well, a DC 80 Survival or Tracking check must be made, as well as a DC 30 Cooking or DC 70 INT check. In order to feed the group poorly, a DC 40 survival check will suffice. Players will not regenerate any HP when not well fed. 3 checks can be made for hunting per day. Each roll >=90 will add an additional day''s rations for the group.
	For Gathering (Awareness check), a DC 80 will poorly feed the group.

	After navigating to the crash-site, players may examine the object however they wish, once they discover the door, they will hear the sounds of engines. DC 60 Knowledge [Technology] or DC 50 Piloting check will identify the engines as non-human. 

	Second Engagement
