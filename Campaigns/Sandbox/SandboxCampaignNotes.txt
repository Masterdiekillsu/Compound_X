Characters introduced: Don Mariovincci, lead of the local criminal element. very powerful.

//========================================

Gypsi Swift lands on Circini I, stalkers in tow. (Tiger and crew)




The Resplendant Courier was carrying a passenger. This passenger is cryogenically frozen. 

The mysterious Skarvotsky Association is competing to get to the cargo first. nothing is known about them, other than the Don''s warning not to pursue them.

unbeknownst to the group of mercenaries, the SA are a shadowy offshoot of the Reformed Soviet Union. Skarvotsky Association is a mysnomer referring to a black ops unit within the RSU Spetsnaz who are responsible for observation and assessment of ECSC strength. Although the official relationship between the RSU and ECSC is a reluctant allegience due to the threat of extinction from alien forces, RSU Special Purpose Force (Spetsnaz) has been tasked with obtaining the cargo aboard the Resplendant Courier in order to aid the RSU in developement of some of their secret projects.

//========================================
// Circini I
//========================================

The group lands on Circini I, a nicer, well established planet. There are vast expanses of industrial area where raw crystals from the nearby planets are forged into nanites. On the north pole of the planet, on one of the larger continents there is a sprawling urban region. This is where the main space-port is.
The planet is mostly desert, except for the poles which are more temperate.

//=======================================

Group finds a clue to a vast fortune. The clue warns them of extreme danger between them and an ancient artifact. The artifact holds clues for the location of the Cache.

Location 1: 0067 Hydri IV
Jungled land covers 45% of this Calcium-Hydroxide pocketed planet. It is about the size of earth, but much denser. A Carbon Dioxide atmosphere neccesitates the use of environment suits.

This planet''s high-elevation mountains are covered in thick, sprawling "jungles". It is not inhabbited by humans due to a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere which is toxic to Terran species. Gravity is a little higher than on earth, so players take a -1 strength penalty while on the surface or at low orbit.

Scanning the planet takes a DC 65 Piloting or Computer Use check to find a weak beacon of sorts. This beacon leads to a small clearing near a cliff-face, at the foot of a small mountain range. Unbeknownst to the group, these mountains are filled with wolf-hawks, which will hunt the players down. If anyne makes a navigation or spot check higher than 65, they see an overgrown trail marker, leading them to the cliff-face.

On closer inspection of the cliff, it can be observed that there is a small crevasse, with what looks like hand-holds. Players will need to make several climbing checks, each DC 40. Once the travellers have successfully passed a few checks each, they find themselves atop a small shelf at the mouth of a dark, tall, tunnel which is shielded from the roaring Calcium Hydroxide ocean below.

The Cave is dry and very straight. A survival 30 check will reveal that it was probably carved through the ground, and not naturally occuring. A survival 50 check reveals that the cave slopes ever so slightly upward, keeping a farily constant distance from the surface of the planet. There is one trap 100m into the cave
