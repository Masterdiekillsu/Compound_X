The Resplendant Courier was carrying a passenger. This passenger is cryogenically frozen. 

The mysterious Skarvotsky Association is competing to get to the cargo first. nothing is known about them, other than the Don''s warning not to pursue them.

unbeknownst to the group of mercenaries, the SA are a shadowy offshoot of the Reformed Soviet Union. Skarvotsky Association is a mysnomer referring to a black ops unit within the RSU Spetsnaz who are responsible for observation and assessment of ECSC strength. Although the official relationship between the RSU and ECSC is a reluctant allegience due to the threat of extinction from alien forces, RSU Special Purpose Force (Spetsnaz) has been tasked with obtaining the cargo aboard the Resplendant Courier in order to aid the RSU in developement of some of their secret projects.

The group lands on Circini I, a nicer, well established planet. There are vast expanses of industrial area where raw crystals from the nearby planets are forged into nanites. On the north pole of the planet, on one of the larger continents there is a sprawling urban region. This is where the main space-port is.
The planet is mostly desert, except for the poles which are more temperate.
