Description of Attitude, demeanor, etc:
    Backstory:
        A young and on the rise bounty hunter begins to deal with
        transitioning from the life of being the son of a wealthy merchant
        clan to being an interstellar renowned bounty hunter and detective.
        Underlining this outward transmission is an internal struggle as he deals
        with leaving behind his partner of several years after his new
        lifestyle drove her away. His drive for success and prominence in
        this field is an epiphany he had one night, that only by taking
        action can one right the wrongs done on a daily basis. After years of
        watching his father''s company grow into an inter-sector crime
        syndicate and the strife this brought on the people victimized by its
        activity Yamada decides to dedicate his life to training to bring it
        down.

    Morality:
        Yamada is a very good aligned character. He sympathizes with those who
        feel little control over their lives, and seeks to achieve control of
        his.

    He starts at level 1 just beginning to step into the adult world and
    hungry to prove his worth. He is driven by his desire to practice his
    trade and achieve expertise. A cautious thinker and determined combatant
    Yamada trains hard to utilize his superior wit to out-think his opponents.
    This cunning and his traditional Japanese look have earned him the nickname
    "Katsune". Since then he has begun to wear a red fox kabuki mask.
    As he matures in his field and starts to make a real life for himself an
    opportunity appears which would aid him greatly in his quest to right the
    wrongs of his family: an invitation for an interview to train with a
    master in the arts.



Clothes:
Medium grey cloak (cloaking suit) worn over a black Hakima and red Kimono top.
He wears a full-seal fox kabuki-mask which is magnetically attached to his
hood and to his face. The mask bears a slight snarl and is white with red
detail around the eyes, mouth, and the ears. The mask is controlled by a smart
reactive system which monitors Yamada''s body, giving him information about
his vitals and inventory. The mask features LCD eyes which portray the emotion
on Yamada''s face, and a jaw which lowers to allow for better respiration when
Yamada''s heart rate increases. Additionally the mask pairs with Yamada''s
augmented processing by feeding it more accurate sensor data. It has also been enhanced with IR vision and Atmosphere Filtration modules.
Weapons:
Yamada trains extensively in Shorinji Kempo and Iaido, preferring to fight
with a Katana or fists when it comes to close-quarters. When extreme pressure
is at hand, he uses his Mk25 rifle to take out targets from afar.
