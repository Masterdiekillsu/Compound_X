//Lore description
It is the year 2348. The confederation exists as a central governing body with many outliers and colony worlds established in nearby star systems. Earth scientists have recently broken into the field of faster-than-light travel, and have miraculously developed very speedy means of travel (faster, in fact than most space-fairing races would develope). By manipulating artificial gravity wells, ships are able to rip holes between two points, seeming to disappear and reapear dozens of lightyears away in a few seconds. However this speed comes at a cost, the travel is not very efficeint. Most jumps are very costly in energy, requiring weeks of recharge time in order to jump any distance, or a refuel at a local planet. They are highly inaccurate as well, often jumping up to a quarter of a billion kilometers away from their intended target, equal to a month''s journey maximum, even using state-of-the-art Bussard-Ramjet engines. The disparity between predicted and actual exit location wildly diverges proportional to the distnace jumped. The farthest distance possible to travel in a single jump is nearish to 30 LY away, any further than that and the journey to actual target may verywell take longer than 5 years with Bussard-Ramjet engines.

The nearest colonies form an "inner ring," comprised of 7 planets within 15 LY from earth. farther out, up to 300 LY away are the "mid-ring" territories, numbering 8 sectors each with around 20 colony worlds. All in total, the Earth Confederacy-Colony Union (ECCU) makes up almost 200 planets, and a population closing in on 40 billion. Beyond the mid ring are the "outer territories," some unofficial colonies, corporate ventures and secret military outposts. The known mapped region of space in the milky way extends to about 400 LY from earth (mathematically speaking, the outer territories alone are 7/9 as large as the whole area of the inner and middle regions. Its a lot of area actually).



//Specific Event Reminders
HARD contact: Hostile Alien Race Detected contact warning.
FARLAND protocol: First Alien Race: Labled as Negative Disposition.
FARLAND protocol enacted sends a "flash probe" back to the nearest Inner-Rim military instalation via a randomized coordinate jump in order to warn humanity of hostile contact. The enacting ship wipes all drive data of earth and ECCU colonies, all long-range transmissions are cut and nuclear self-destruct (primed to the captain's voice) is primed.
