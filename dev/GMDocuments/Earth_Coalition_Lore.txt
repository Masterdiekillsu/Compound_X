//==============================
// Government System and Society
//==============================

Government is a republic, consisting of 8 core planets, one acting as a representitive for each sector.
Currently the senate hub is on Pectoris in the Tau Ceti F system.

The EC is broken up into 3 broad regions: Core Region, Middle Rim, and Outer Rim.

It is the year 2348. The confederation exists as a central governing body with many outliers and colony worlds established in nearby star systems. Earth scientists have recently broken into the field of faster-than-light travel, and have miraculously developed very speedy means of travel. By manipulating artificial gravity wells, ships are able to rip holes between two points, seeming to disappear and reapear dozens of lightyears away in a few seconds. However this speed comes at a cost, the travel is not very efficeint. Most jumps are very costly in energy, requiring weeks of recharge time in order to jump any distance. They are highly inaccurate as well, often jumping up to a quarter of a billion kilometers away from their intended target, equal to a month''s journey maximum, even using state-of-the-art Bussard-Ramjet engines. The disparity between predicted and actual exit location wildly diverges proportional to the distnace jumped. The farthest distance possible to travel in a single jump is nearish to 30 LY away, any further than that and the journey to actual target may verywell take longer than 5 years with Bussard-Ramjet engines.

The nearest colonies form an "inner ring," comprised of 7 planets within 15 LY from earth. farther out, up to 300 LY away are the "mid-ring" territories, numbering 8 sectors each with around 20 colony worlds. All in total, the Earth Confederacy-Colony Union (ECCU) makes up almost 200 planets, and a population closing in on 40 billion. Beyond the mid ring are the "outer territories," some unofficial colonies, corporate ventures and secret military outposts. The known mapped region of space in the milky way extends to about 400 LY from earth (mathematically speaking, the outer territories alone are 7/9 as large as the whole area of the inner and middle regions. Its a lot of area actually).


in the middle rim, the government has a moderate amount of control over the populace. However, this is mostly just due to the corporations respecting the wishes of the government for the sake of the subsidies given to the corporations. 
For the most part, major corporations run the middle and outer rims. These corporations have their hands in mining, manufacture, transportation, etc.



each Organization owns their own subset of the artifacts and so each "Religion" is owned/run by an Organization

Solar Energy -> Battery Ship

Tau Ceti F -> Pictoris

Technological Artifacts:
	Given by gods?
	Tech reverse engineered from artifacts

superbase, 2 small carriers, 2 small cruiser/battleships

EP not available in all parts of the coalition. Cash is necessary sometimes to buy supplies.
