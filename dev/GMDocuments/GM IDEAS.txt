//General Ideas

Feat or class which has minor time control?
An example of a feat or class ability would be pay 50 nanites for an extra full action on your turn.

Western Campaign

$500 for a days work as an adventurer or mercenary. $2500/week, $10,000/month
Square meals
Ammunition used
depending on mission, about 3 O-O-G metings, 1 encounter per meeting, $1000 per encounter, $3000 per contract.
1 meal = $15

Change armour pricing steeper, and make certain "Levels" of armour correspond to certain materials.
Level 2 = Steel Plate 10 10
Level 3 = Ceramic Plate 15 20
Level 4 = Carbon-Steel Fiber 20 30
Level 5 = Ceramic Nano-Crystal 25 40
Switch rolling of armour penitration to attacker, makes more sense that you have to roll to hit not their armour. also that way anyone with a feat that negates part of armour can add that to their roll instead of telling the defender to do that.
