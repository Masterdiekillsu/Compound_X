Atelsakor Plasma Weapons
All plasma weapons in this category deal necrotic damage and inflict plasma 
burn.
If a plasma shot from these weapons hits armour, instead of dealing damage to 
the target after DR, the plasma shot will melt through the armour, dealing its 
amount of damage to the PH of the armor.
