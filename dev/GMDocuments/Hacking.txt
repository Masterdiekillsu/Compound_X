 * Priest Hacking Abilities
 *======================================*/

 Systems in compound X are built up of many different nodes representing functions within the system. There might be a node for a single door control, or there might be a node representing an electronic light switch. There are four categories that these nodes can fall into:
    - Blockers: Mainly Firewalls, but other systems can impede access to parts of the network. Crypto-systems would be an example of a blocker node within an information network.
    - Interactables: Correspond to some action in the real-world. Light operation, door controls, etc.
    - Information: Mainly file systems / PCs, but could include other things.
    - Traps: appear to be one or another type of node. Have negative affects on a priest who attempts to attack or probe them if they don''t detect and then disarm the trap.
Basic hackers can interract with nodes in three ways, and also perform various skill checks while analyzing a system:
    - Attack: Allows accss to the next set of nodes in the system (depending on the architecture some regions can be compartmentalized to discourage enemy hackers gaining full control of the network); or allows hacker to control that node.
    - Probe: reveals what nodes are beyond the probed node without controlling the node or activating any nodes beyond it. Sort of like peeking through a keyhole, you can see whats beyond the door without anything in the room beyond knowing you''re looking.
    - Monitor: Any time the node in question is used, the one monitoring is notified. The hacker monitoring the node can also see traffic going through a node and choose to intercept the trafic if they wish. Probing and attacking a node alert someone monitoring it. Firewalls are generally monitored, although with high enough skill, or a lucky roll, a hacker can enter a system without alerting someone monitoring the firewall. (injection technique).
There are other ways of interacting with nodes. Priests can create software nodes to set traps or monitor a line. There are also other ablities available to higher level Priests.

Robotic units can also be hacked. When expecting an attack the DC is much higher. Hacked robots can be manipulated in a few ways: (in order of difficulty)
    - Halt action
    - deactivate
    - Take cover
    - Leave cover
    - Move
    - Fire
