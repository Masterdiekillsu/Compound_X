/////	3.Poison: Mild Halucinogen
Nanite Cost:20
Duration: 	5 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Target must pass a DC 70 Will check. If they fail, 
they suffer one of four effects as chosen by GM or by random dice roll:
- Target panics and runs away as fast as he can
- Target beleives nearest ally is a vicious, man-eating, submarine-sized
ferret, bent on eating his belly button and attacks accordingly
- Target is tricked into thinking he is being eaten alive by bugs and
strips naked immediately and attempts to squish them all
- Target discovers that their weapon is actually a sprinkler, and begins
watering the grass dilligently
Halucinogens only affects biologic targets.
		
/////	4. Quarentine
Nanite Cost:120
Duration: 	Half Action
Range:		2 to 8m radius within 30m at your discression
Effect:		All enemies within the the radius of effect cannot leave 
the area of effect. Effect persists for 8 turns.
		
/////	5. Poison: Fentanyl Derivative
Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		Target must pass a DC 60 Shock check for every action they take over
the next 3 turns. If they fail a check, the action they were about to take is
canceled and they lose that action. If they fail three checks they pass out. 
if they pass out, they must pass a shock check of 120 to wake up. Only works
on biologic targets.

/////	6. Breakout
Nanite Cost:60
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		15m to 20m radius, with Doc as the center
Effect:		Apply a payload of poison of your choosing to every target in range.
Targets with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

/////	7. Multi Spikes
Nanite Cost:90
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		30m
Effect:		You launch off three nanite spikes in quick succession using both
hands. Each has an 18 % chance to miss. You may pick up to three targets to 
launch at. Each spike that hits deals 52 piercing damage. If target has no 
shield left and is still alive, apply a poison payload of your choice.

/////	8. Poison:	PAX
Nanite Cost:100
Duration: 	1 Day
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		A target exposed to the PAX strain must pass a DC 240 Will save.
Upon losing the save, the target rolls 1d100 (2d10, one for the 10's place,
one for the 1's place as usual). If the target does not roll a 14, the target
is instantly pacified. A pacified target will not attack anyone or anything
for any reason, even if it has reason to fear for its life. It will comply
with simple commands slowly, as if in a stupor. Prolonged exposure to PAX
will result in targets ceasing to eat, sleep, or move until they starve to
death. In the event that a 14 is rolled, the target reacts badly to the PAX.
The target will enter an unsatiable rage, and will attack the nearest living
thing - bare handed if need be - with total disregard for the target's saftey.
A target that has reacted badly to PAX will never lie down. It will continue
to kill and eat any living target until it dies of overconsumption or exaustion.
PAX only affects biologic targets.

/////	9. Epidemic
Nanite Cost:80
Duration: 	Standard Action
Range:		30m to 35m radius, with Doc as the center

Targets with gas masks are immune. Allies are targeted as well.

/////	10. Poison:	NF-34
Nanite Cost:80
Duration: 	20 turns
Range:		Payload (use in combination with other powers)
Effect:		The biologic agent eats away at the target's flesh and biologic 
parts at an astonishing rate. The target takes 3d10 damage per turn for the 
duration of their afliction. They can be cured by decontamination devices or 
specially trained medics. Targets that are wearing a gas mask, but have any 
exposed biology are affected by this even if a deployment method says they 
wouldn't. Use of biologic weapons are severely frowned upon in most civilized 
regions of space.

/////	11. Poison: Thiopental Derivative

you don't need to worry about smuggling it anywhere.

Nanite Cost:30
Duration: 	Half Action
Range:		40m
Effect:		16 % chance to miss. Deal 52 piercing damage.
