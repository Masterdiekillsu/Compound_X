Armour redux

damage types:
ballistic damage is a physical force which emparts damage on a physical level. Bullets are the most common form of ballistic damage. A sabbot round from a gauss rifle is another example of a ballistic damage source.
mellee damage is from any weapon which can slash, stab, or bludgeon. Swords, knifves, fists, etc. handheld simple weapons.

energy damage is damage which on an atomic or chemical level breaks down items. Lasers, Plasma, and Arcane (nanite) based attacks are the most common sources of energy damage.

Armour types:
Shields protect against most forms of energy damage. They usually come in three classes, A, B and C, which determine their capacity and recharge rate.

Standard armour protects from most ballistic and mellee damage sources, as well as some non-traditional damage sources such as explosive, or some effects from Nanite-based sorcery (like Shards for example).

Lasers will cut right through Standard Armour, and deal their full damage to the target. Similarly, bullets, knives, firs, and explosions will go right through a shield, dealing full damage to the wearer. Plasma exists as a physical entity, but is also influenced by energy. As such, Plasma is partially stopped by both shields and armour, but to a lesser degree than either''s normative damage type.

Any n+ level of protection, the amount of Damage Reduction (DR) is rolled at the time of purchase. A level 4+ armour plate might be anywhere from 16-25 DR for its lifetime, depending on what you roll when you purchase it. These armours are a bit of a gamble, since they may provide better protection than the next tier up, or they might only provide marginally better protection than the last tier.

//==============================
// Shields
//==============================
    Shield units are still a developing technology. They are generally more expensive than other forms of protection, and most often used in industry to protect miners and crewmen while doing EVAs. The same technology has been found useful in lessening the effect of energy based weapons, but is not widely available to the public. Rest assured that wearing a Shield generator will paint you as someone to be wary of, and you will stick out.
    
    When activated, a translucent blue sheen appears inches away from the wearer''s body. Multiple Field Manipulation points exist within the vest in order to maintain proper shield density and shape, so the shield looks as if it consists of multiple 2D faces joined together.
    
    Shield Basics:
    There are 4 classes of shields: A, B, C and D.The shields come in light, medium, or heavy variants. Shield class cooresponds to recharge rate, while the variant cooresponds to capacity. Additionally, Shields come in either 50% coverage, which merely covers the critical regions (center mass) of the body, and 100% coverage, which is a shield that covers the entire torso.

//Armour cost / price analysis stats
//==============================
Armour cost listed is per plate. Plate Carriers list number of plate slots. Side plate sets are half of the cost of a full plate. 

Soft Armour Vest (Can be worn under plate carriers to compound protection)
    Soft armour vests are cheap alternatives to plate carriers with hard armour plates. They are not as tough as hard armour, and after a few shots they will need to be replacced. (Replace every 4 missions)
