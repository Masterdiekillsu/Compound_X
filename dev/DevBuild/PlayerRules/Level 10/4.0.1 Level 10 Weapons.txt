//Devnotes
Generic plasma shotgun. generated offline without access to price tool. 
Personality is expensive, glowing and should be one of the most efficient ways for a
player to disperse plasma at close range. Xenon is a nobel gas sometimes excited 
to plasma state for use in Neon-like signs. ('cause it's a different color)
devnotes will not be pushed to play branch
//Taylor's notes
I''ve changed it to Neon. I''ve written up in the GM Munition Info doc that the different types of noble gasses produced different densities of plasma. Heavier element plasmas deal more plasma burn tokens. Since this is supposed to be a basic plasma shotgun, Neon would make sense.

Schroder C-6 $3220
This Over-Under shotgun fires special Shotshells which each contain 3 caseless rounds. Loading is as simple as breaking open the barrels and inserting 1 shell into each barrel. Each round must be individually pumped into the rail chamber, leading to a unique break-barrel loaded, pump action firearm.
