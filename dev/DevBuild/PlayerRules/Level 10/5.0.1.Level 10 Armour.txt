/*========================================
 * STANDARD BALISTIC ARMOURS
 *======================================*/

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Undersuits
//Various undersuits exist, providing buffs to the wearer. Undersuits are
//wearable by all classes unless otherwise stated. Undersuits provide a 
//damage reduction to any hits that miss armour. Additionally any damage
//which only affect a limb has the suit's DR applied to it. Undersuits
//count as a full set of clothing, so any clothes worn over them look out
//of place.
    //Flightsuits offer basic protection from the elements.
    //Traditionally come in Tan, Olive Drab, Wolf-Grey, Dark Earth, Black, Camo Patterns, etc.    

    //These environment suits are air- and water-tight when combined with an EVA helmet. They are bulky and any DEX skill-checks are at a -10% and movement is reduced in RP.
    //Traditionally come in white, yellow or red.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Concealed Setups
//Offering slightly worse protection and armament for the price, but with
//the bonus of being concealable under a coat or jacket for clandestine or
//stealth oriented operations.
    
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Recon Armour Setups:
//Tactical Vest with soft armour underneath. Soft armour must be repaired
//or replaced after every 4 missions / conflicts / battles (assuming damage
// received during each)
//3 primary mags, 2 secondary mags, 1 grenade.
    
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Light Armour Setups:
//A "Chest Rig" which holds one front plate and some gear.
//4 primary mags, 4 of combined secondary mags and grenades.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Medium Armour Setups:
//A smaller plate carrier which holds a moderate amount of gear.
//6 primary mags, 5 of combined secondary mags and grenades.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Heavy Armour Setups:
//A hefty plate carrier which holds front, back and side plates as well as
//extended amounts of gear.
//8 primary mags, 6 of combined secondary mags and grenades.
//With side plates included (any armour listed as 80% coverage) take a -1m movement speed penalty.
    
    //Ceramic Plate

    //Carbon-Steel Fiber    

    //Ceramic Nano-Crystal  

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//Covers the front of your chest, your back, your sides, shoulders, neck, pelvic region, and tops of your legs.
//8 primary mags, 6 of combined secondary and grenades.

/*========================================
 * SHIELD UNITS
 * Shields cover the wearer in a magnetic field which repels lasers
 * and removes some of the brunt of plasma bolts. They are completely
 * open to balistic fire, however. Traditionally a shield unit
 * consists of a generator pack which is generally the size of a
 * small backpack, and some Magnetic Field Stabilizers that extend
 * over the areas of the body which would be covered by the shield.
 * Once the shield's capacitor units are exhausted, the shield breaks
 * and needs a while to recharge. If the user maintains their shield
 * without letting it break, they can avoid the costly recharge time.
 * The capacity of the field is dependant on the user mainly, but also varries depending on the shiled model.

 * SHIELDED ARMOUR
 *======================================*/



/*========================================
 * NANITE CLOAKING ARMOURS
 * Devote a Portion of your nanite pool to a clocking pool.
 * Lvl 1-5 expend 15 Nanites per cloak turn. Lvl 6+ 10 Nanites.
 * Max Turns of cloak = Lvl +1; Cloaking becomes available after waiting 4 Actions.
 * Cloaking grants the wearer stealth at a DC of 50. However, when a player cloaks, enemies will not see them unless they are actively looking for the wearer. For enemies that saw the wearer cloak, the DC is 25 less.
 * Wearers need only expend nanites on a turn that they perform actions. if they are doing nothing but watching, they may cloak for free. Cloaking requires concentration, so when a user diverts their attention to perform an action, they must use some nanites to continue to hold the cloak.
