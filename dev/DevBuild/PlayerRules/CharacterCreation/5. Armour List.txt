Any n+ level of protection, the amount of Damage Reduction (DR) is rolled at the time of purchase. A level 4+ armour plate might be anywhere from 16-25 DR for its lifetime, depending on what you roll when you purchase it. These armours are a bit of a gamble, since they may provide better protection than the next tier up, or they might only provide marginally better protection than the last tier.
