/*==================================================
 * External Augmentations
 * This document outlines the two forms of external augmentation:
 * Combat frames, and combat suits. Combat Frames are lighter, 
 * providing no armour bonuses themselves and are simple ways of
 * increasing physical combat effectiveness. Combat Suits on the
 * other hand offer better protection and many modular attachment 
 * points.
 * Suits and frames are not water-proof, and will cease functioning
 * if fully submerged. They are resistant to water, so rain and
 * splashes of water will not affect them. However any amount of
 * water pressure will breach the seals and fry the circuitry
 * controlling the frame/suit.
 * Stat increase can affect any stat except Charisma or Luck.
