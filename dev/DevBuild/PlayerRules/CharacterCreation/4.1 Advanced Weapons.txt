Shotguns:
All pump shotguns take 1 action to fire, 1 action to rack. In the racking action, you can load an additional round of your specification for free. Double barrel and semi auto shotguns do not follow this rule.
For buck shot:
Roll d10 for # shots that make contact. Each shot does listed damage.
Outside of range, roll d10 for # shots, with the normal minimum number being the maximum number. E.G. for the hunting shotgun, if you shoot a target at 50m, roll a d10. If you roll a 6, you only hit with 5 pellets.
Outside of range for slugs, subtract 20 damage, and 20%.
Dragon''s Breath does not hit outside of range.
Minimum Strength 4, Reload DC 30% unless otherwise noted. Reload time 3 Half Actions
