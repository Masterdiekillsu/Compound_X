/*==================================================
 * External Augmentations
 * This document outlines the two forms of external augmentation:
 * Combat frames, and combat suits. Combat Frames are lighter, 
 * providing no armour bonuses themselves and are simple ways of
 * increasing physical combat effectiveness. Combat Suits on the
 * other hand offer better protection and many modular attachment 
 * points.
