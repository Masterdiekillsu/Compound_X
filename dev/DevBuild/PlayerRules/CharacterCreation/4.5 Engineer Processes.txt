=====		Repair Tree		=====
=================================
Network Motes: Any repair process that an engineer uses on a cybernetic ally
(even if that process doesn't specify that it can only be used on cybernetic
allies) leaves a "network mote" on that ally. When calculating roaming range
of drones built in the build tree, the range of the drone is taken from the
nearest network mote or the engineer that deployed it.

====================	  Cyberphysical			====================
/////	Reboot
Nanite Gain:65
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Only usable on cybernetic allies that are "bleeding" out. That ally
is now stable and has 30 hp, rather than having to stabalize the target and 
then heal them. Not a quiet proceedure; detectable within 40m by a perception 
check of 30.

/////	Data Scrub
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Only usable on cybernetic allies who have been hacked or dominated.
The engineer makes a repair check opposed by half of the hacker's hack check or
dominator's sorcery check. If the engineer wins, the ally or system is scrubbed
and the system control returns to normal. The engineer only receives nanites 
for successful scrubs. Be aware that engineers are not the only class that can
scrub a hacked target.

/////	Restore Armor
Nanite Gain:50
Action: 	Full Action
Duration:	Almost Instant
Range: 		Touch
Effect:		You tinker with your ally's armor and mend it. Undo any debuffs on
your ally's armor such as sundering, battle damage, etc. 

/////	Percussive Matainence
Nanite Gain:30
Action:		Half Action
Duration:	Almost Instant
Range:		Touch
Effect:		This stupid thing is broken again! You hit it with your wrench and
deal 10 damage to it. Roll luck modifier, with a DC of 1.5 x target's total 
damage after wrench hit. Add to that DC 10 for each minor status effect and
15 for each major status effect, at the GM's discretion. If The DC is passed,
Fix all minor status effects, one major status effect, or heal one wound. This
process may only be performed on cybernetic allies, turrets, vehicles or as
an RP event. Not to be confused with the concussive maitnence feat.

/////	Defrag
Nanite Gain:15
Action:		Half Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You auto-balance your cybernetic ally's priority queues, defrag
their memory and basically perform typical matainence. Feeling refreshed,
your ally continues on their way. Your ally gets a +5% bonus to their next
RP roll.

/////	Actuator Overdrive
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch
Effect:		For an engagement, an ally moves 3m per action more. Ally 
movement has an absolute cap of 14m per action, even if some other effect
would make it higher. A player may not be overclocked more than once per 
engagement. Only works on cybernetic allies.


/////	Discrete Overclock
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch
Effect:		A cybernetic ally gets a -8% to miss for the duration of the 
engagment. They also get a +15 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to 
perception checks. 

/////	Network Targeting
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You interface a visual triangulation unit with your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors. It cross-references targets with other friendly 
machine's sensors to deliver a more complete image of the target. Your
cybernetic ally gets a -3% to miss their next target for each friendly
drone, robot and turret that is also looking at that target. This effect
may be blocked with a hacking attack at DC 20. 

/////	System Overclock
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	Engagement
Range:		Touch
Effect:		A cybernetic ally gets a -14% to miss for the duration of the engagment.
They also get a +35 to reloading weapons quickly and a +10 to perception checks, but
take 20 damage from system overheat.

/////	Colocation Processing
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration:	Until First Use
Range:		6m
Effect:		You use your onboard manufacturing system processor as a dedicated
server to help process your cybernetic ally's analytic data. The next time that
ally makes a lockpick, hacking, explosives, repair, heal, or tracking check, 
they get a +15 to it. 

/////	Regression Override
Nanite Gain:60
Action:		Half Action
Duration:	8 Turns
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You temporarily dissable your cybernetic ally's regression system,
the part of their personality program that slows down to triple check the 
results of their actions. This sends them into a rage mode. They still know
friend from foe, and they still have a jenky understanding of their higher-
order skills like lockipicking, hacking, or social finess, but they have no
fear, no pain, no remorse and no hesitation for about half of a minute. Your
ally Cannot feel shock durring this durration, and cannot be repaired (they
won't stand still). They get a bonus +15% to accuracy nearer than 41m. They
also deal an extra 20 damage with melee or fire an extra bullet with rapid-
fire weapons. They take a penalty of 25% to skill checks, including accrobat or
parkour checks (these take regression to calculate). An ally affected by 
Regression Override may use a strength +2 bonus at any time, but each time they
do, they take 20 damage of wear and tear. An engineer can only perform a 
regression override once per encounter. Regression Overrides do not stack.

/////	System Restore
Nanite Gain:35
Action:		Full Action
Duration: 	Permanent
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Can only be used on a cybernetic subject who's primary datacenter 
is still intact that has "bled out" less than 8 turns ago. The Engineer makes 
a DC 60 repair check. If successful, the subject is now "bleeding out". If the
subject is saved, they get the feat "Refurbished". Characters with the 
"Refurbished" feat have a permanent -1 to Intelligence and can never again be
revived with System Restore.

====================	Material/Mechanic		====================
/////	Duct Tape
Nanite Gain:40
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Ok, there was a little more to it than that. One of your targets 
wounds are healed. This trick only works on cybernetic allies. This also works
on non-sentient robots and machinery.

/////	Weapon Tuning
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	engagement
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You fiddle with your ally's gun quickly. You tune the whosits, and
dial the whatsits. It now has a -5% chance to miss and has half the chance of
jamming. Normal use and wear on the gun will almost definitely unalign what 
you've done by the end of the engagement, but hopefully your efforts will help 
keep your ally alive until then.

/////	Vehicle Repair
Nanite Gain:40
Action:		2 Full Actions
Duration:	almost instant
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You pull out your tools and quickly repair the damage to a friendly
vehicle. It gains 1 vehicle health. While this power is not required to repair
vehicles, it does add a nanite reward for doing so. It also increases the 
effect and may reduce the time taken to repair. 

/////	Multisys Repair
Nanite Gain:30*n
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	N/A
Range:		Touch
Effect:		The automaton is healed by the Engineer's heal roll / n, where n is 
the number of wounds that the atomaton has. This trick only works on cybernetic 
beings or machines.

///// Micro Assembler
Nanite Gain:50
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch
Effect: You release a spider-like micro repair bot that repairs a cybernetic
ally for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbot is able to heal
15 health per turn. The microbot burns up in CS burn. A Microassembler uses
wireless cloud calculation to stay small, but on-blueprint. As such, it is
vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A hacked micro assembler reveals its
location and may deal 5 damage per turn.

/////	Engine Tuning
Nanite Gain:50
Action:		3 Full Actions
Duration: 	Almost Instant
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You crack open the hood of whatever vehicle is around and begin to
clean the spark plug, dial in the cylindar timing and add your own special
sauce to the engine's fuel injector. It will now run at 125% power, and it has
full health. Effect may vary by RP. See GM for details. While this power is not
required to boost the effect of a vehicle, it now rewards you in nanites for
doing so and increases your effectivity at doing so.

/////	Boilerplate Handiwork
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	Permanent
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Just slam some more metal on there! You add a protective layer to
one of your cybernetic allies. This adds 40 to their health, but slows them
down by 1m per action. This effect lasts until that 40 health has been 
destroyed, or until the engineer takes it off and discards it.

/////	Zero Friction Covalent
Nanite Gain:20
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	Until next melee hit
Range:		Touch
Effect:		You coat your ally's weapon with a friction-negating substance that
binds with the blade on the molecular level, which makes it easier to slice 
through targets. Add one to the weapon's damage multiplier. The substance isn't
very durable and is difficult to handle, so an engineer can't use it on their
own weapon and the effect only lasts until the next hit. Cannot be used on a 
weapon more than once at a time.

/////	Sup it Up
Nanite Gain:80
Action:		6 Full Actions
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		Touch
Effect:		Target friendly vehicle has full health, and its engine runs at
maximum efficiency. Full effect is up to Role Playing and GM. Additions
include but are not limited to:
adding a NOS tank
adding a 1-vehicle damage sheild
adding stabalized chassis for improved accuracy when fired from 

/////	Ceramic Catalyst
Nanite Gain:	15 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		10 turns or 2 hits
Range:			Touch
Effect:			An adheisive mist of kenetic-reactive ions that cause ceramic
armor plates to absorb hits more effeciently by powdering instead of cracking.
Toxic, but slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can only be used on 
cybernetic allies with light, medium, heavy or full armor. An engineer only 
carries four doses per engagement. Reduces the next bullet hit by 35 points of 
damage. Looks kinda like yellow ooze. Gives an ally affected by Ceramic 
Catalyst a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. An engineer cannot use ceramic
catalyst on themselves. Ceramic Catalys decays after exposure to elements for
ten turns or two hits, whichever happens first. 

///// Microbot Swarm
Nanite Gain:40 * n
Action:		Half Action
Duration: 	8 turns
Range:		4m radius
Effect: You release a swarm of spider-like micro repair bots that repair 
cybernetic allies for 8 turns before running out of power. The microbots are 
able to heal 15 health per turn. The microbots burn up if one of their subjects
is affected by CS burn. For this, the engineer gains 40 * n nanites, where n is 
the number of allies affected. The engineer can only perform this once per 
engagement. A Microassembler uses wireless cloud calculation to stay small, 
but on-blueprint. As such, it is vulnerable to hack checks at a DC of 50. A 
hacked micro assembler reveals its location and may deal 5 damage per turn.
The microbot swarm director automatically detects disobedient microbots.

====================	Optronic/Cycotonic		====================

/////	Repulsor Recharge
Nanite Gain:	20 nanites
Action:			Half Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch
Effect:			Recharges an ally's sheild by 60 points. Cannot be used to
charge an ally's sheilds over their max value. An engineer cannot recharge
their own sheilds.

/////	Sensory Fuse
Nanite Gain:	10 nanites
Action:			Half Action
Duration:		Until fuse pops
Range:			Touch
Effect:			You install an auto-ejecting Sensory Overload Fuse in your
cybernetic ally's audio and visual signal processors. The fuse pops and 
negates the effect of a flashbang or other such device. Fuses take a steady
hand to install, so an engineer cannot install one in themselves.

/////	B-Filter Buffer
Nanite Gain:	15 nanites
Action:			Half Action
Duration: 		For one visual perception check
Range:			Touch
Effect: Adds a hyper-fast self-consuming buffer between a cybernetic ally's 
optics and their processor. This filter interfaces with the Bayer Filter to 
remove false artifacts and perform several Just-In-Time post processing. Uses 
a disposable one-time use paracrystal network that degrades after a time for 
optimal effeciency. Increases ally's visual perception by 10%.

/////	Repulsor Overcharge
Nanite Gain:	25 nanites
Action:			Half Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch
Effect:			Recharges an ally's sheild by 60 points. May be used to charge
an ally's sheilds to up to 30 points above their maximum. Sheilds will 
normalize down to their maximum after ten turns. 

/////	Refractory Spray
Nanite Gain:	15 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch
Effect:			An adheisive mist of refractive particles that absorb laser and
plasma fire quite well. Toxic, but slow-acting to most biologic life forms. Can
only be used on cybernetic allies or terrain. An engineer only carries four 
doses per engagement. Reduces the next plasma/laser/CS hit by 35 points of 
damage and prevents the first damage-over-time effect from that hit, if it has
one. Looks kinda like sticky glitter. Gives an ally affected by Refractory 
spray a -20 penalty to visual stealth rolls. Refractory Spray can be detected
by metal detectors. Refractory Spray loses cohesion after ten turns or burns up
if hit by an energy attack.

/////	Tune Laser
Nanite Gain:	30 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		5 Turns
Range:			Touch
Effect:			You dial in the potentiometers and realign the focusing 
crystals. Your ally's weapon deals an extra 20 points of damage per hit
and has a -10% to miss (To a maximum of 0% when target is in light cover). 

/////	MoCap Augmentation
Nanite Gain:	20 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch
Effect:			By temporarily reducing the resolution of your cybernetic 
ally's visual sensors you radically reduce the processing power it takes to
capture motion, letting them process more frames per microsecond. This gives
them slightly faster reaction times, resulting in a -8% chance to miss when
attacking, but makes it much harder to see long distances. Allies with MoCap
Augmentation active take a -40 to perception checks at ranges beyond 50m. 
Since this is less than ideal in non-combat scenarios, you've set it to wear
off after ten turns.

/////	Repulsor Projection
Nanite Gain:	10 nanites
Action:			Half Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			10m
Effect:			Recharges an ally's sheild by 40 points. May not be used to
charge a sheild above it's maximum capacity. An engineer may not charge their
own sheilds. 

/////	Repulsor Hypercharge
Nanite Gain:	40 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			Touch
Effect:			Recharges an ally's sheild by 85 points. May be used to charge
an ally's sheilds up to 60 points above their maximum. Sheilds will normalize
down to their maximum by 5 points per turn at the beginning of that player's
turn. Hypercharged sheilds make a distinctive crackling noise; players who's
sheilds are hypercharged take a -20 to stealth rolls. An engineer cannot
hypercharge their own sheilds.

/////	Broadcast Repulsion
Nanite Gain:	15 * n nanites, where n is the number of sheilds affected
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		Immediate
Range:			8m radius centered on engineer
Effect:			All allies with sheilds in the area of effect have their 
sheilds recharged by 40 points. This may not charge them over their maximum. If
more than two sheilds were affected and more than 60 points restored total, the
feedback wave sets a 10 damage per turn for 4 turns to any enemies in the area
of effect as well. A feedback wave ends the engineer's turn immediately.

/////	CS Lacer
Nanite Gain:	20 nanites
Action:			Full Action
Duration:		10 Shots
Range:			Touch
Effect:			You must pass a DC 40 skill check on your ally's weapon to 
replace their muzzel mod with a CS-Lacing capacitor. Their next ten shots 
set a 15 damage CS burn for 4 turns. After that ten shots, the Lacer's 
capacitor will have grounded and subsequent shots will jam the gun. Your
ally will have to make a skill check to swap back their muzzle attatchment.

Note:
nanites used to "glue" modular bits of tech together and to allow tech to function. After a certain amount of time the nanites die and the item crumbles. At higher levels, the nanites are able to last longer so the item can be used longer. 
Drones do not count as "cybernetic allies" for most repair skills, though you can repair them with
repair kits as normal. They take their turns independantly, with 2 Full actions per turn, and they
take their owner's (not necissarily their deployer's) initiative. A Drone can only use 4 IO ports 
at a time unless otherwise stated. 

====================	Embeded Systems		====================
/////	Dragonfly
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	40 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			2 Full Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	1 port
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				20
Speed:				6m per Action
Roaming range:		6m from deployer.
Size:				.5m x .5m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70
Effect:		The dragonfly is a small, light, fast flying drone that stays close
to it's deployer. Unlike most drones, it cannot use external network motes to 
increase its range.  It's onboard sensor network gives it's deployer a +6 to 
perception rolls. It's landing gear can also grasp and carry objects weiging
less than 8kg. Powered by a Li+ battery, will almost never explode when 
destroyed. Due to it's not-quite-quiet rotors, limits deployer's stealth scores
to a maximum of 75. If the deployer moves outside of its 6m service range, the
dragonfly will passively move to the nearest point to it that is in range.
When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it occupied,
but does not reimburse its controler's nanites that were used to assemble it.
Due to its small size and jerky flight movement, a Dragonfly that moved on the
same turn that it is shot at adds a 25% chance for the attacker to miss.

/////	KRO-W5
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			3 Full Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	3 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				46
Speed:				8m per Action if unladen. 6m per Action if a port contains
a peripheral.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				.5m x .1m x .2m
Disrupt DC:			80
Pwn DC:				120
Effect:				The KRO-W5 or "Crow" is a lightweight quad-rotor drone 
designed for low-altitude opperation. Combining agility with modularity. Its
onboard targeting laser gives the ally nearest to it a +10 bonus to accuracy 
against the nearest enemy that it has line of sight to. It also has a redundant
kernal checksum system to make hacking it more difficult. While unladen, its
rotors run slightly quieter than most; as long as it isn't carrying anything 
and its ports are unused, it has a maximum stealth check of 90. It runs on a
Li+ battery and almost never explodes when destroyed. The Crow doesn't come
with landing gear typically, so to get it to carry something other than a 
peripheral an engineer would have to jerry rig something on to it. See GM for 
Role Playing options. 
When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it occupied,
but does not reimburse its controler's nanites that were used to assemble it.

/////	PD-5 Scout Bot
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	60 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 1 point
Build Time:			3 Full Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	5 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				86
Speed:				9m per Action if unladen and health is over 80. 
					-4m per action if health < 80. -2m per action if a 
					peripheral has changed health total.
Roaming range:		10m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .6m x .8m
Disrupt DC:			50
Pwn DC:				90
Effect:				This small bipedal drone comes equiped with a distributed
computing NIC card for improved performance in large packs. The PD-5 also comes 
standard with a biomemetic sharp grasping claws and a tail that adapts 
proceeduraly to maintain balance at high speeds as  well as significalntly more
capacity for paripherals than its flying brethren. The Grasping claws may make 
melee attacks at a 40% chance to miss for 40 damage ignoring armor. PD-5 bots 
take a -20% to miss for each other friendly PD-5 within 6m due to their 
distributed network architecture, but if one PD bot is pwnd, all PD bots within
that range are pwnd as well. Disrupted PD-5 bots don't count for other's 
accuracy bonus.
Standard PD bots make soft hydraulic sounds when moving, and so may not have 
stealth scores over 80. This limitation may be solved with clever RP, see your
GM with ideas.  
When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it occupied,
but does not reimburse its controler's nanites that were used to assemble it.

/////	Cerberus Attack Drone
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	220 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 2 points
Build Time:			4 Full Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	9 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				216
Speed:				4m per Action
Roaming range:		8m from network mote.
Size:				1m x .8m x 1m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70
Effect:				Cerberus attack drones are large, heavily armored and armed
battlefield behemoths that move slowly but pack a nasty bite. Powered by an 
uberfuel that tends to explode in a 3m radius when destroyed. They move slowly
and have trouble with stairs, but their turret can quickly turn and fire. They
come with armor that covers 80% of their systems and reduces incoming fire by 
30 points. One anti-vehicle hit will down them however. Large enough for a 
player to take partial cover behind. 
When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it occupied,
but does not reimburse its controler's nanites that were used to assemble it.

/////	Titan Multipurpose Drone
Type: 				Drone
Construction Cost:	350 Nanites
Control Point Cost: 4 points
Build Time:			4 Full Actions
Modular I/O ports: 	13 ports
Duration: 			Permanent
Health:				300
Speed:				7m per Action
Roaming range:		20m from network mote.
Size:				1.2m x 1.2m x 2.4m
Disrupt DC:			30
Pwn DC:				70
Effect:				The titan multipurpose drone is a bipedal megalith of death
and science. Plasma induction core explodes violently when destroyed. 
The titan comes with a 7.62 repeater that has a 20% chance to miss and deals 55 
damage. fed from a 150 round drum. May also make melee attacks with its offhand.
20% chance to miss. Deals 160 damage, kinda like being punched by a backhoe. 
When a drone is reclaimed, it frees up the control point cost that it occupied,
but does not reimburse its controler's nanites that were used to assemble it.

/////	Peripheral: popgun
Type:				Peripheral

Build Time:			1 Full Action
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Ammo:				Holds 4 shots
Accuracy:			20%
Damage:				20 points
Range:				20m
How does 40 kV feel? Does 7x damage to sheilds. Does 4x damage to drones or 
robotic enemies. If an enemy was hit with this attack, and the drone this was
launched with has not yet left the 20m range (i.e. the tazer wires are still
connected) you may spend one shot that automatically hits as a free action.
Senteant targets hit by this attack must pass a DC 80 shock check to keep from
being paralyzed on their following turn. 

/////	Peripheral: Armor
Type:				Peripheral
Construction Cost:	25 nanites
Build Time:			1 Full Action
Modular I/O ports:	Uses 1 port
Coverage:			+50%
Reduction:			20 points

/////	Insta-Cover
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		30 nanites
Build Time:		1 Full Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			2 Vehicle Health
Size:			2m x .2m x .8m
Effect:			Sometimes the low-tech solution is best. You unfold a series of
armadillo ceramic and carbon nanotube plates that are pretty good at stopping
bullets. This gives partial cover for 2 meters in one direction. 

/////	Barbed Wire
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		20 nanites
Build Time:		1 Half Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			60 health points; immune to bullets but not to slashing weapons.
Size:			1m x .1m x .3m
Effect:			You keep a coil of barbed wire for those times when you need to
				politely discourage someone from going a particular way. The
barbed wire is clearly visible, and any character attempting to move out of a
space occupied by barbed wire must pass a DC 70 FORT check. A character in/on 
barbed wire takes 30 slashing/cutting damage for each full action or after 
every second half action. Barbed wire does not hinder certain ethereal 
characters.	Barbed wire does not hinder most vehicles, but it can pop tires.			

/////	Adaptive Gun Mount
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		10 nanites
Build Time:		1 Full Action
Duration:		Permanent

Effect:			You set up a recoil-dampening weapon stand that grants partial
cover and a +10% accuracy bonus to whomever sets up here. Will fit in windows,
off the back of a truck, etc. Adheres to a solid, flat surface. Engineer who
built it gets 10 nanites every time an ally hits a target using their gun mount.
does not proc for an engineer using their own mount.


/////	Gun Emplacement
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:60 Nanites
Build Time:	Full Action
Duration: 	Permanent
Health:		1 vehicle health
Size:		1m x 1m x 1m
Effect:		You piece together a heavy turret with a 200 round 5.56 calibur belt
of ammo. The balistic plate in front offers partial cover for whomever uses it.
Each hit deals 53 damage and the gun has a 30% chance to miss. It cannot be 
aimed, but it can be ripped off of its emplacement by a character that has 8 
strength or more. When ripped off, the gun has an additional 10% chance to 
miss. If the gun is fired four times, with four consecutive half actions, the
shooter gets a free fifth shot. Every hit that an ally (not you) makes with a
turret that you placed gives you 30 nanites. Supporting Fire weapon.

/////	Snare
Type:				Trap
Construction Cost:	5 nanites
Build Time:			1 Half Action
Disarm DC:			30%
Damage:				0 points
Range:				1 particular square meter
Effect:				DC 20 + (20 * Engineer character Level) for an enemy to 
					spot with a max of 90. When a character steps on a snare,
their movement ends. They may not move until they pass a DC 60 Fortitude check.
An additional fortitude check may be made at the cost of a half action. If the
engineer who made this is at least level 5 and has an intelligence of at least
8, the DC to escape is 80. If Int 8 and level > 10, DC is 120. Snares burn if
damaged with fire or plasma and break if slashed. Snares may be shot, but are
considered 'hunkered behind cover' at all times. Snares cannot be detected with
detect high tech. Snares will trap friendly characters.

/////	Scavenge
Type:			Action
Nanite Cost:	20
Scrap Time:		1 Full Action
Range:			Touch
Effect:			You gather materials from fallen foes or derelict equipment in 
the feild to replenish your stock of components. You gain an amount of nanites
depending on the condition, size, complexity and familiarity of what you are
scavenging. Your GM gets the final say on what your returns are, as a baseline,
an enemy Detatchment Security Drone would be worth about 80 nanites. Yoou cannot
Scavenge active machinery. Some machinery may be too complex to scavenge or may
be incompatible with your microassembler.

Range:			Touch
Effect:			You gather materials from an opperating enemy robot, turret or drone in 
the field to replenish your stock of components. You gain an amount of nanites
depending on the condition, size, complexity and familiarity of what you are
scavenging. Your GM gets the final say on what your returns are, as a baseline,
an enemy Detatchment Security Drone would be worth about 120 nanites.

/////	Heavy Mortar
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:320 Nanites
Build Time:	4 Full Actions
Duration: 	Permanent
Health:		1 vehicle health

Damage:				250 points or 4 vehicle damage
Range:				6m radius
Effect:				"um... sir, should you be... are you cleared to have that?"
					Won't detonate if shot. Even with plasma. And, boy does 
this sucker pack a punch. DC of 30 to hack it and set it off early. Setting one
gives you a remote that can easily be held in an off hand, even if using a 2
handed weapon. If a teammate detonates the ANFO, the engineer that set it gains
10 nanites. Anyone within 9m radius of the blast gets an "ears are ringing"
status effect which gives a -90% to perception checks based on sound for three
turns. Remote ANFO comes in a sticky bundle and will cling to any shaped hard 
surface. It will even cling to the wings of dropships during reentry.

====================	Force Multiplier	====================
/////	Bubble Shield
Type: 		Structure
Construction Cost:40 Nanites
Build Time:	Full Action
Duration: 	30 rounds or end of encounter
Health:		30
Size:		1m x 1m x 1m
Effect:		You set up a local shield generator that creates a 4m radius dome
shield that nobody can shoot through, but anyone can walk through or melee
through. The shield will stop 120 damage per turn or one vehicle damage
before popping. Once a shield has popped, it will need to be repaired at a cost
of 20 nanites and one full action. Cannot be repaired more than twice.


/////	Entrench
Type:			Structure
Build Cost:		50 nanites
Build Time:		4 Full Actions
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			4 Vehicle Health
Size:			Various
Effect:			Perhaps one of your most useful tallents is being able to 
quickly cobble together good cover from whatever is lying about and what
you brought in your pack. Sometimes this means ripping up the floor, digging
into the ground to make a simple pillbox, sometimes this means bolting some
ceramic plates onto that coffee table over there and setting it where you
need it to be. However you pull it off, you manage to create a 2m x 2m area
of good cover for 360 degrees. 

/////	Spotter
Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		30 nanites
Build Time:		1 Full Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			40 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m
Effect:			You create a specialized drone that will only follow a Marksman
who is friendly. The spotter takes its turn with that marksman, and takes 
orders from that marksman. It comes equiped with night vision, thermal imaging,
advanced audio sensor arrays and EM spectrum sweepers. It gives audio and visual
cues to what it sees. Unless otherwise specified, it's voice is that of an 
English butler's. It may make up to 3 perception checks per turn using the 
Marksman's perception modifier (since they are working as a team) at a bonus of
20 points. It does not need to roll perception to detect cloaked characters 
within 20m, since they show up like lit christmas trees on the EM sweepers. In 
an emergency, the spotter may move up to 12m and self-destruct on a close-range
target, dealing 30 damage and emitting a flash similar to a flashbang. 

/////	Parabolic Antenae



/////	Noisy Cricket
Type:			Disposable munition system
Build Cost:		55 nanites
Build Time:		1 Full Action
Duration:		until it runs out of ammo
Accuracy:		25%
Clip:			4
Damage:			60 within 1m radius of hit.
Effect:			"I uh... haven't figured out how to fit the cartridge into a 
				magazine without it ... you know... exploding. But what's in
it should work just fine." you hand an ally (not you) a little sidearm that 
has been your pet project for a while. Ignores sheilds. After every shot,
the player who fired it rolls luck. If they roll over 80 (modified), all
enemies who took damage have their sheilds wink out due to EMP. If they
roll under 10, their sheilds and any nearby allies within 5m of them lose 
their sheilds due to EMP. Does not effect the function of drones or robots.
Every enemy hit with the noisy cricket gives 30 nanites to the engineer who
built it.


/////	Oversheild Inductor
Type:			Drone
Build Cost:		40 nanites
Build Time:		1 Full Action
Duration:		Permanent
Health:			20 Points
Size:			.5m x .5m x .3m
Effect:			You create a small flying drone that follows one particular
				ally (not you). The drone carries an addaptive resonator and
nanite sheild inductor that overcharges your teammate's sheilds to 40 points 
above their usual max. It also heals any damage to your teammate's sheilds 
by 20 points at the end of your teammate's turn every turn. It's not really
quiet though, so the teammate that the drone is following cannot score stealth
rolls above 70. For every 20 points (including the first 40 of over-heal) of
sheild strength that the drone heals, the engineer who built it gets 15 
nanites in return.

/////	Hunter

/////	Medic Drone
