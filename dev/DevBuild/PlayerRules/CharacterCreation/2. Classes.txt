Core classes:
//====================================================
Your character starts at level 0. At level 0 you have skills and feats, but no class or class feats.
At level 1 you get to select a class, and recieve the class passives. However, you do not select a class feat until level 5.
On selecting a class, you gain all of the passives listed, and get to choose between one of two listed feats. For any listed class, if it says "Gain X Skill at 10" that means you get to add the X skill to your skill list, and it starts at rank 10, meaning a +10% to any roll for that skill. At the first level taken in a class (other than level 1), you get the single star version of the feat. At level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter, you can choose to rank up the feat, or add the other feat to your character.
