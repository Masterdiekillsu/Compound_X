// Tank Weapons
// Typically for a tank it doesn't matter if you deal a ton of damage. It's my
// personal belief that since the role of a tank is to take damage and distract
// the enemy, decent damage is important, but so id staying in the fight. Most
// of the weapons I customize in this category have a higher magazine capacity 
// than others in the same classification.
