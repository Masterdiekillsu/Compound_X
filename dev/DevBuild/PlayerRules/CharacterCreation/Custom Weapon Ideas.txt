// Tank Weapons
// Typically for a tank it doesn't matter if you deal a ton of damage. It's my
// personal belief that since the role of a tank is to take damage and distract
// the enemy, decent damage is important, but so is staying in the fight. Most
// of the weapons I customize in this category have a higher magazine capacity 
// than others in the same classification.

// LR Mitigation Weapons
// aka "Oh no, someone is approaching from far away / leaving beyond the reach
// of the rest of the team!"; aka "We need to pin target X so they can't
// harass us"; aka: Single Target Damage Beast.
// This class of weapon benefits most from having the lowest Miss Chance
// possible in order to overcome cover bonuses. If you can get a weapon below
// -25% Miss Chance, you can almost guarantee favorable outcomes. Most weapons
// with this kind of capability are bolt action though, so the first thing to
// do is spec your character with 8 Dex or higher in order to make advantage of
// the straight pull bolt. With Dex this high, it might be advisable to take
// the "Hands of an Artist" feat as well and ignore perception as your primary
// stat. Weapon damage is a consideration here, but only secondarily to "Can I
// hit it?" Its assumed that characters fulfilling this role will take feats 
// allowing them special abilities to increase their damage with long rifles or
// providing them with options other than shooting the target into submission.
